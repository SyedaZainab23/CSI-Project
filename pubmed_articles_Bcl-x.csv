38612914,Lentivirus-Mediated BCL-X,"Hematopoietic reconstitution after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is influenced by the number of transplanted cells. However, under certain conditions donor cell counts are limited and impair clinical outcome. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) expansion prior to HSCT is a widely used method to achieve higher donor cell counts and minimize transplantation-related risks such as graft failure or delayed engraftment. Still, expansion in a non-physiological environment can trigger cell death mechanisms and hence counteract the desired effect. We have shown earlier that during HSCT a relevant amount of HSPCs were lost due to apoptosis and that cell death inhibition in donor HSPCs improved engraftment in xenotransplantation experiments. Here, we assessed the effect of combined ex vivo expansion and cell death inhibition on HSPC yield and their reconstitution potential in vivo. During expansion with cytokines and the small molecule inhibitor StemRegenin 1, concomitant lentiviral overexpression of antiapoptotic BCL-X",2024
38600316,Combination p53 activation and BCL-x,"Due to the rarity of TP53 mutations in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), p53 re-activation by antagonism of the p53-MDM2 interaction represents a potential therapeutic strategy for the majority of ALL. Here, we demonstrate the potent antileukemic activity of the MDM2 antagonist idasanutlin in high-risk and relapsed ex vivo coculture models of TP53 wildtype ALL (n = 40). Insufficient clinical responses to monotherapy MDM2 inhibitors in other cancers prompted us to explore optimal drugs for combination therapy. Utilizing high-throughput combination screening of 1971 FDA-approved and clinically advanced compounds, we identified BCL-x",2024
38548768,Development and crystal structures of a potent second-generation dual degrader of BCL-2 and BCL-xL.,"Overexpression of BCL-xL and BCL-2 play key roles in tumorigenesis and cancer drug resistance. Advances in PROTAC technology facilitated recent development of the first BCL-xL/BCL-2 dual degrader, 753b, a VHL-based degrader with improved potency and reduced toxicity compared to previous small molecule inhibitors. Here, we determine crystal structures of VHL/753b/BCL-xL and VHL/753b/BCL-2 ternary complexes. The two ternary complexes exhibit markedly different architectures that are accompanied by distinct networks of interactions at the VHL/753b-linker/target interfaces. The importance of these interfacial contacts is validated via functional analysis and informed subsequent rational and structure-guided design focused on the 753b linker and BCL-2/BCL-xL warhead. This results in the design of a degrader, WH244, with enhanced potency to degrade BCL-xL/BCL-2 in cells. Using biophysical assays followed by in cell activities, we are able to explain the enhanced target degradation of BCL-xL/BCL-2 in cells. Most PROTACs are empirically designed and lack structural studies, making it challenging to understand their modes of action and specificity. Our work presents a streamlined approach that combines rational design and structure-based insights backed with cell-based studies to develop effective PROTAC-based cancer therapeutics.",2024
38499818,In silico design of potential Mcl-1 peptide-based inhibitors.,"BIM (Bcl-2 interacting mediator of apoptosis)-derived peptides that specifically target over-expressed Mcl-1 (myeloid cell leukemia-1) protein and induce apoptosis are potentially anti-cancer agents. Since the helicity of BIM-derived peptides has a crucial role in their functionality, a range of strategies have been used to increase the helicity including the introduction of unnatural residues and stapling methods that have some drawbacks such as the accumulation in the liver. To avoid these drawbacks, this study aimed to design a more helical peptide by utilizing bioinformatics algorithms and molecular dynamics simulations without exploiting unnatural residues and stapling methods. MM-PBSA results showed that the mutations of A4fE and A2eE in analogue 5 demonstrate a preference towards binding with Mcl-1. As evidenced by Circular dichroism results, the helicity increases from 18 to 34%, these findings could enhance the potential of analogue 5 as an anti-cancer agent targeting Mcl-1. The applied strategies in this research could shed light on the in silico peptide design. Moreover, analogue 5 as a drug candidate can be evaluated in vitro and in vivo studies.",2024
38492518,Human parainfluenza virus type 2 V protein inhibits mitochondrial apoptosis pathway through two ways.,"Paramyxoviruses are reported to block apoptosis for their replication, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Furthermore, regulation of mitochondrial apoptosis by paramyxoviruses has been hardly reported. We investigated whether and how human parainfluenza virus type 2 (hPIV-2) counteracts apoptosis. Infection of recombinant hPIV-2 carrying mutated V protein showed higher caspase 3/7 activity and higher cytochrome c release from mitochondria than wild type hPIV-2 infection. This indicates that V protein controls mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. hPIV-2 V protein interacted with Bad, an apoptotic promoting protein, and this interaction inhibited the binding of Bad to Bcl-X",2024
38426376,"Characterization of BCL-X L , MCL-1, and BAX Protein Expression in Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer.","The use of chemotherapy has improved the overall treatment of breast cancer, which is frequently administered in the form of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Apoptosis is an established cell stress response to NAC in preclinical models; however, there is limited understanding of its role in clinical cancer, specifically, its contribution to favorable pathologic responses in breast cancer therapy. Here, we aimed to characterize the change in protein expression of 3 apoptosis-associated biomarkers, namely, BCL-X L , MCL-1, and BAX in breast cancer in response to NAC. For this, we utilized a set of 68 matched invasive breast cancer FFPE samples that were collected before (pre) and after (post) the exposure to NAC therapy that were characterized by incomplete pathologic response. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis suggested that most of the samples show a decrease in the protein expression of all 3 markers following exposure to NAC as 90%, 69%, and 76% of the matched samples exhibited a decrease in expression for BCL-X L , MCL-1, and BAX, respectively. The median H-score of BCL-X L post-NAC was 150/300 compared with 225/300 pre-NAC ( P value <0.0001). The median H-score of MCL-1 declined from 200 pre-NAC to 160 post-NAC ( P value <0.0001). The median H-score of BAX protein expression decreased from 260 pre-NAC to 190 post-NAC ( P value <0.0001). There was no statistically significant association between the expression of these markers and stage, grade, and hormone receptor profiling (luminal status). Collectively, our data indicate that the expression of apoptosis regulatory proteins changes following exposure to NAC in breast cancer tissue, developing a partial pathologic response.",2024
38383492,Modification of BCLX pre-mRNA splicing has antitumor efficacy alone or in combination with radiotherapy in human glioblastoma cells.,"Dysregulation of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic protein isoforms arising from aberrant splicing is a crucial hallmark of cancers and may contribute to therapeutic resistance. Thus, targeting RNA splicing to redirect isoform expression of apoptosis-related genes could lead to promising anti-cancer phenotypes. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common type of malignant brain tumor in adults. In this study, through RT-PCR and Western Blot analysis, we found that BCLX pre-mRNA is aberrantly spliced in GBM cells with a favored splicing of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL. Modulation of BCLX pre-mRNA splicing using splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) efficiently elevated the pro-apoptotic isoform Bcl-xS at the expense of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL. Induction of Bcl-xS by SSOs activated apoptosis and autophagy in GBM cells. In addition, we found that ionizing radiation could also modulate the alternative splicing of BCLX. In contrast to heavy (carbon) ion irradiation, low energy X-ray radiation-induced an increased ratio of Bcl-xL/Bcl-xS. Inhibiting Bcl-xL through splicing regulation can significantly enhance the radiation sensitivity of 2D and 3D GBM cells. These results suggested that manipulation of BCLX pre-mRNA alternative splicing by splice-switching oligonucleotides is a novel approach to inhibit glioblastoma tumorigenesis alone or in combination with radiotherapy.",2024
38377677,Structural Insights into the Interaction between the C-Terminal-Deleted BH3-like Motif Peptide of Hepatitis B Virus X Protein and Bcl-x,Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) plays a crucial role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The full-length HBx protein interacts with Bcl-x,2024
38316463,Genome-wide CRISPR screen reveals the synthetic lethality between BCL2L1 inhibition and radiotherapy.,"Radiation therapy (RT) is one of the most commonly used anticancer therapies. However, the landscape of cellular response to irradiation, especially to a single high-dose irradiation, remains largely unknown. In this study, we performed a whole-genome CRISPR loss-of-function screen and revealed temporal inherent and acquired responses to RT. Specifically, we found that loss of the IL1R1 pathway led to cellular resistance to RT. This is in part because of the involvement of radiation-induced IL1R1-dependent transcriptional regulation, which relies on the NF-κB pathway. Moreover, the mitochondrial anti-apoptotic pathway, particularly the BCL2L1 gene, is crucially important for cell survival after radiation. BCL2L1 inhibition combined with RT dramatically impeded tumor growth in several breast cancer cell lines and syngeneic models. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of an apoptosis inhibitor such as a BCL2L1 inhibitor with RT may represent a promising anticancer strategy for solid cancers including breast cancer.",2024
38172496,BCL-XL regulates the timing of mitotic apoptosis independently of BCL2 and MCL1 compensation.,"Mitotic catastrophe induced by prolonged mitotic arrest is a major anticancer strategy. Although antiapoptotic BCL2-like proteins, including BCL-XL, are known to regulate apoptosis during mitotic arrest, adaptive changes in their expression can complicate loss-of-function studies. Our studies revealed compensatory alterations in the expression of BCL2 and MCL1 when BCL-XL is either downregulated or overexpressed. To circumvent their reciprocal regulation, we utilized a degron-mediated system to acutely silence BCL-XL just before mitosis. Our results show that in epithelial cell lines including HeLa and RPE1, BCL-XL and BCL2 acted collaboratively to suppress apoptosis during both unperturbed cell cycle and mitotic arrest. By tagging BCL-XL and BCL2 with a common epitope, we estimated that BCL-XL was less abundant than BCL2 in the cell. Nonetheless, BCL-XL played a more prominent antiapoptotic function than BCL2 during interphase and mitotic arrest. Loss of BCL-XL led to mitotic cell death primarily through a BAX-dependent process. Furthermore, silencing of BCL-XL led to the stabilization of MCL1, which played a significant role in buffering apoptosis during mitotic arrest. Nevertheless, even in a MCL1-deficient background, depletion of BCL-XL accelerated mitotic apoptosis. These findings underscore the pivotal involvement of BCL-XL in controlling timely apoptosis during mitotic arrest, despite adaptive changes in the expression of other BCL2-like proteins.",2024

38117383,Disrupting Development: Unraveling the Interplay of Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) and Wnt/β-Catenin Pathways in Kidney Development Under the Influence of Environmental Pollutants.,"Understanding the intricate molecular mechanisms governing aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and Wnt/β-Catenin pathways crosstalk is of paramount importance for elucidating normal development. We investigated the repercussions of aberrant activation of these signaling pathways on kidney development. HEK-293 cells were subjected to AHR and Wnt activators and inhibitors for 3 and 24 h. Subsequently, pregnant adult female BALB/c mice were administered treatments at gestation day 9 (GD-9), and embryos were analyzed at GD-18 using a combination of cellular, molecular, stereological, and histopathological techniques. Our results demonstrated a noteworthy escalation in oxidative stress and gene expression endpoints associated with apoptosis. Moreover, stereological analyses exhibited alterations in cortex, proximal tubule, and kidney tissue vessels volumes. Remarkably, co-treatment with 6-formylindolo [3,2-b] carbazole (FICZ) and cadmium (Cd) resulted in a significant reduction in glomerulus volume, while elevating the volumes of distal tubule, Henle loop, and connective tissue, compared to the control group. Histopathological investigations further confirmed structural changes in the loop of Henle and proximal tubule, alongside a decline in glomerular volume. Additionally, the expression levels of AHR and Ctnnb1 genes significantly increased in the Cd-treated group compared to the control group. Enhanced expression of apoptosis-related genes, including Bcl-x, Bax, and Caspase3, along with alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome C release, was observed. In contrast, Gsk3 gene expression was significantly decreased. Our findings robustly establish that chemical pollutants, such as Cd, disrupt the AHR and Wnt/β-Catenin physiological roles during developmental stages by inhibiting the metabolic degradation of FICZ.",2023
38053351,Gamma-mangostin Protects S16Y Schwann Cells Against ,"Peripheral neuropathy is a common complication that affects individuals with diabetes. Its development involves an excessive presence of oxidative stress, which leads to cellular damage in various tissues. Schwann cells, which are vital for peripheral nerve conduction, are particularly susceptible to oxidative damage, resulting in cell death.",2023
38024975,Tetrazole and acylsulfonamide bioisosteric replacements of the carboxylic acid in a dual MCL-1/BCL-x,"Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1 is associated with a plethora of human cancers, and it reduces the sensitivity of cancer cells to approved chemotherapies. Accordingly, the discovery of MCL-1 inhibitors is an active area of interest. Many inhibitors of the anti-apoptotic MCL-1 protein bear a crucial carboxylic acid that may engage Arg263 in the BH3-binding groove. We previously described the salicylic acid-based dual MCL-1/BCL-x",2023
37945692,BH3 mimetics and azacitidine show synergistic effects on juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.,"Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is an aggressive hematopoietic disorder of infancy and early childhood driven by constitutively active RAS signaling and characterized by abnormal proliferation of the granulocytic-monocytic blood cell lineage. Most JMML patients require hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for cure, but the risk of relapse is high for some JMML subtypes. Azacitidine was shown to effectively reduce leukemic burden in a subset of JMML patients. However, variable response rates to azacitidine and the risk of drug resistance highlight the need for novel therapeutic approaches. Since RAS signaling is known to interfere with the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, we combined various BH3 mimetic drugs with azacitidine in our previously established patient-derived xenograft model. We demonstrate that JMML cells require both MCL-1 and BCL-X",2024
37943248,Elucidating the interaction of C-terminal domain of Vaccinia-Related Kinase 2A (VRK2A) with B-cell lymphoma-extra Large (Bcl-xL) to decipher its anti-apoptotic role in cancer.,"Vaccinia-Related Kinase 2 (VRK2) is an anti-apoptotic Ser/Thr kinase that enhances drug sensitivity in cancer cells. This protein exists in two isoforms: VRK2A, the longer variant, and VRK2B, which lacks the C-terminal region and transmembrane domain. While the therapeutic importance of VRK2 family proteins is known, the specific roles of VRK2A and its interplay with apoptotic regulator Bcl-xL (B-cell lymphoma-extra Large) remain elusive. Bcl-xL regulates cell death by interacting with BAX (B-cell lymphoma-2 Associated X-protein), controlling its cellular localization and influencing BAX-associated processes and signaling pathways. As VRK2A interacts with the Bcl-xL-BAX complex, comprehending its regulatory engagement with Bcl-xL presents potential avenues for intervening in diseases. Using a multi-disciplinary approach, this study provides information on the cellular localization of VRK2A and establishes its interaction with Bcl-xL in the cellular milieu, pinpointing the interacting site and elucidating its anti-apoptotic property within the complex. Furthermore, this study also put forth a model that highlights the importance of VRK2A in stabilizing the ternary complex, formed with Bcl-xL and BAX, thereby impeding BAX dissociation and hence apoptosis. Therefore, further investigations associated with this important revelation will provide cues for designing cancer therapeutics in the future.",2023
37904054,ATP1A1/BCL2L1 predicts the response of myelomonocytic and monocytic acute myeloid leukemia to cardiac glycosides.,"Myelomonocytic and monocytic acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subtypes are intrinsically resistant to venetoclax-based regimens. Identifying targetable vulnerabilities would limit resistance and relapse. We previously documented the synergism of venetoclax and cardiac glycoside (CG) combination in AML. Despite preclinical evidence, the repurposing of cardiac glycosides (CGs) in cancer therapy remained unsuccessful due to a lack of predictive biomarkers. We report that the ex vivo response of AML patient blasts and the in vitro sensitivity of established cell lines to the hemi-synthetic CG UNBS1450 correlates with the ATPase Na",2024
37898609,The identification of BCL-XL and MCL-1 as key anti-apoptotic proteins in medulloblastoma that mediate distinct roles in chemotherapy resistance.,"Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant paediatric brain tumour, representing 20% of all paediatric intercranial tumours. Current aggressive treatment protocols and the use of radiation therapy in particular are associated with high levels of toxicity and significant adverse effects, and long-term sequelae can be severe. Therefore, improving chemotherapy efficacy could reduce the current reliance on radiation therapy. Here, we demonstrated that systems-level analysis of basal apoptosis protein expression and their signalling interactions can differentiate between medulloblastoma cell lines that undergo apoptosis in response to chemotherapy, and those that do not. Combining computational predictions with experimental BH3 profiling, we identified a therapeutically-exploitable dependence of medulloblastoma cells on BCL-XL, and experimentally validated that BCL-XL targeting, and not targeting of BCL-2 or MCL-1, can potentiate cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in medulloblastoma cell lines with low sensitivity to cisplatin treatment. Finally, we identified MCL-1 as an anti-apoptotic mediator whose targeting is required for BCL-XL inhibitor-induced apoptosis. Collectively, our study identifies that BCL-XL and MCL-1 are the key anti-apoptotic proteins in medulloblastoma, which mediate distinct protective roles. While BCL-XL has a first-line role in protecting cells from apoptosis basally, MCL-1 represents a second line of defence that compensates for BCL-XL upon its inhibition. We provide rationale for the further evaluation of BCL-XL and MCL-1 inhibitors in the treatment of medulloblastoma, and together with current efforts to improve the cancer-specificity of BCL-2 family inhibitors, these novel treatment strategies have the potential to improve the future clinical management of medulloblastoma.",2023

37824434,BCL-xL Targeting to Induce Apoptosis and to Eliminate Chemotherapy-Induced Senescent Tumor Cells: From Navitoclax to Platelet-Sparing BCL-xL PROTACs.,"Restoring apoptotic cell death is a critical goal for cancer therapy. One of the primary mechanisms by which cancer cells evade death and maintain survival in the face of stress signals is by overexpression of prosurvival B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) family members such as BCL2, BCL-xL, and MCL1, which suppress the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway of apoptosis through complex protein and membrane interactions. While these antiapoptotic proteins have been validated as potent therapeutic targets, synthesis of their inhibitors remained challenging for decades mainly due to the presence of a difficult to target, highly hydrophobic groove on the surface. The groove serves as a binding site for the BH3 domain of corresponding proapoptotic partners, which leads to their sequestration and prevents apoptosis. In 2008, a Cancer Research article by Tse and colleagues, led by Dr. Steven Elmore from Abbott Laboratories, reported the discovery of the first orally bioavailable BCL2/BCL-xL inhibitor, navitoclax (ABT-263), marking the onset of an era of ""BH3 mimetics"" in cancer therapeutics and changing the therapeutic landscape especially for leukemia. Here, we reflect on how this landmark study fueled development of small-molecule BH3 mimetics like venetoclax and seek to indicate new strategies and future directions for improving the clinical activity of navitoclax for hematologic malignancies. See related article by Tse and colleagues, Cancer Res 2008;68:3421-3428.",2023
37811881,Alternative splicing of BCL-x is controlled by RBM25 binding to a G-quadruplex in BCL-x pre-mRNA.,"BCL-x is a master regulator of apoptosis whose pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced into either a long (canonical) anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL isoform, or a short (alternative) pro-apoptotic Bcl-xS isoform. The balance between these two antagonistic isoforms is tightly regulated and overexpression of Bcl-xL has been linked to resistance to chemotherapy in several cancers, whereas overexpression of Bcl-xS is associated to some forms of diabetes and cardiac disorders. The splicing factor RBM25 controls alternative splicing of BCL-x: its overexpression favours the production of Bcl-xS, whereas its downregulation has the opposite effect. Here we show that RBM25 directly and specifically binds to GQ-2, an RNA G-quadruplex (rG4) of BCL-x pre-mRNA that forms at the vicinity of the alternative 5' splice site leading to the alternative Bcl-xS isoform. This RBM25/rG4 interaction is crucial for the production of Bcl-xS and depends on the RE (arginine-glutamate-rich) motif of RBM25, thus defining a new type of rG4-interacting domain. PhenDC3, a benchmark G4 ligand, enhances the binding of RBM25 to the GQ-2 rG4 of BCL-x pre-mRNA, thereby promoting the alternative pro-apoptotic Bcl-xS isoform and triggering apoptosis. Furthermore, the screening of a combinatorial library of 90 putative G4 ligands led to the identification of two original compounds, PhenDH8 and PhenDH9, superior to PhenDC3 in promoting the Bcl-xS isoform and apoptosis. Thus, favouring the interaction between RBM25 and the GQ-2 rG4 of BCL-x pre-mRNA represents a relevant intervention point to re-sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy.",2023
37751299,Hyperphosphorylation of BCL-2 family proteins underlies functional resistance to venetoclax in lymphoid malignancies.,"The B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor venetoclax is effective in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); however, resistance may develop over time. Other lymphoid malignancies such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are frequently intrinsically resistant to venetoclax. Although genomic resistance mechanisms such as BCL2 mutations have been described, this probably only explains a subset of resistant cases. Using 2 complementary functional precision medicine techniques - BH3 profiling and high-throughput kinase activity mapping - we found that hyperphosphorylation of BCL-2 family proteins, including antiapoptotic myeloid leukemia 1 (MCL-1) and BCL-2 and proapoptotic BCL-2 agonist of cell death (BAD) and BCL-2 associated X, apoptosis regulator (BAX), underlies functional mechanisms of both intrinsic and acquired resistance to venetoclax in CLL and DLBCL. Additionally, we provide evidence that antiapoptotic BCL-2 family protein phosphorylation altered the apoptotic protein interactome, thereby changing the profile of functional dependence on these prosurvival proteins. Targeting BCL-2 family protein phosphorylation with phosphatase-activating drugs rewired these dependencies, thus restoring sensitivity to venetoclax in a panel of venetoclax-resistant lymphoid cell lines, a resistant mouse model, and in paired patient samples before venetoclax treatment and at the time of progression.",2023
37723317,Increased MCL1 dependency leads to new applications of BH3-mimetics in drug-resistant neuroblastoma.,"Neuroblastoma is a paediatric cancer that is characterised by poor prognosis for chemoresistant disease, highlighting the need for better treatment options. Here, we asked whether BH3-mimetics inhibiting BCL2 proteins may eliminate chemoresistant neuroblastoma cells.",2023
37704591,Dinaciclib synergizes with BH3 mimetics targeting BCL-2 and BCL-X,"A better understanding of multiple myeloma (MM) biology has led to the development of novel therapies. However, MM is still an incurable disease and new pharmacological strategies are needed. Dinaciclib, a multiple cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, which inhibits CDK1, 2, 5 and 9, displays significant antimyeloma activity as found in phase II clinical trials. In this study, we have explored the mechanism of dinaciclib-induced death and evaluated its enhancement by different BH3 mimetics in MM cell lines as well as in plasma cells from MM patients. Our results indicate a synergistic effect of dinaciclib-based combinations with B-cell lymphoma 2 or B-cell lymphoma extra-large inhibitors, especially in MM cell lines with partial dependence on myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL-1). Simultaneous treatment with dinaciclib and BH3 mimetics ABT-199 or A-1155463 additionally showed a synergistic effect in plasma cells from MM patients, ex vivo. Altered MM cytogenetics did not affect dinaciclib response ex vivo, alone or in combined treatment, suggesting that these combinations could be a suitable therapeutic option for patients bearing cytogenetic alterations and poor prognosis. This work also opens the possibility to explore cyclin-dependent kinase 9 inhibition as a targeted therapy in MM patients overexpressing or with high dependence on MCL-1.",2023
37553948,"Crystal structure of Bak bound to the BH3 domain of Bnip5, a noncanonical BH3 domain-containing protein.","The activation or inactivation of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) antagonist/killer (Bak) is critical for controlling mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization-dependent apoptosis. Its pro-apoptotic activity is controlled by intermolecular interactions with the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain, which is accommodated in the hydrophobic pocket of Bak. Bcl-2-interacting protein 5 (Bnip5) is a noncanonical BH3 domain-containing protein that interacts with Bak. Bnip5 is characterized by its controversial effects on the regulation of the pro-apoptotic activity of Bak. In the present study, we determined the crystal structure of Bak bound to Bnip5 BH3. The intermolecular association appeared to be typical at first glance, but we found that it is maintained by tight hydrophobic interactions together with hydrogen/ionic bonds, which accounts for their high binding affinity with a dissociation constant of 775 nM. Structural analysis of the complex showed that Bnip5 interacts with Bak in a manner similar to that of the Bak-activating pro-apoptotic factor peroxisomal testis-enriched protein 1, particularly in the destabilization of the intramolecular electrostatic network of Bak. Our structure is considered to reflect the initial point of drastic and consecutive conformational and stoichiometric changes in Bak induced by Bnip5 BH3, which helps in explaining the effects of Bnip5 in regulating Bak-mediated apoptosis.",2024
37550099,The potential for citrate to reinforce epigenetic therapy by promoting apoptosis.,"Epigenetic drugs induce ATP depletion, promoting a glycolysis-to-oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) shift which sometimes favors tumor growth by promoting necroptosis over apoptosis. To restore effective apoptosis in tumors, we propose that the administration of citrate could inhibit ATP production, activate caspase-8 (a key necroptosis inhibitor), and downregulate key anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-xL and MCL1).",2023
37511611,"Sertindole, an Antipsychotic Drug, Curbs the STAT3/BCL-xL Axis to Elicit Human Bladder Cancer Cell Apoptosis In Vitro.","Bladder cancer is the leading urinary tract malignancy. Epidemiological evidence has linked lower cancer incidence in schizophrenia patients to long-term medication, highlighting the anticancer potential of antipsychotics. Sertindole is an atypical antipsychotic agent with reported anticancer action on breast and gastric cancers. Yet, sertindole's effect on bladder cancer remains unaddressed. We herein present the first evidence of sertindole's antiproliferative effect and mechanisms of action on human bladder cancer cells. Sertindole was cytotoxic against bladder cancer cells while less cytotoxic to normal urothelial cells. Apoptosis was a primary cause of sertindole's cytotoxicity, as the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk rescued cells from sertindole-induced killing. Mechanistically, sertindole inhibited the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), an oncogenic driver of bladder cancer, as sertindole lowered the levels of tyrosine 705-phosphorylated STAT3 along with that of STAT3's target gene BCL-xL. Notably, ectopic expression of the dominant-active STAT3 mutant impaired sertindole-induced apoptosis in addition to restoring BCL-xL expression. Moreover, bladder cancer cells overexpressing BCL-xL were refractory to sertindole's proapoptotic action, arguing that sertindole represses STAT3 to downregulate BCL-xL, culminating in the induction of apoptosis. Overall, the current study indicated sertindole exerts bladder cancer cytotoxicity by provoking apoptosis through targeted inhibition of the antiapoptotic STAT3/BCL-xL signaling axis. These findings implicate the potential to repurpose sertindole as a therapeutic strategy for bladder cancer.",2023
37451322,Amsacrine downregulates BCL2L1 expression and triggers apoptosis in human chronic myeloid leukemia cells through the SIDT2/NOX4/ERK/HuR pathway.,"Accumulating evidence indicates that the anticancer activity of acridine derivatives is mediated through the regulation of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic BCL2 protein expression. Therefore, we investigated whether the cytotoxicity of amsacrine with an acridine structural scaffold in human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) K562 cells was mediated by BCL2 family proteins. Amsacrine induced apoptosis, mitochondrial depolarization, and BCL2L1 (also known as BCL-XL) downregulation in K562 cells. BCL2L1 overexpression inhibited amsacrine-induced cell death and mitochondrial depolarization. Amsacrine treatment triggered SIDT2-mediated miR-25 downregulation, leading to increased NOX4-mediated ROS production. ROS-mediated inactivation of ERK triggered miR-22 expression, leading to increased HuR mRNA decay. As HuR is involved in stabilizing BCL2L1 mRNA, downregulation of BCL2L1 was noted in K562 cells after amsacrine treatment. In contrast, amsacrine-induced BCL2L1 downregulation was alleviated by restoring ERK phosphorylation and HuR expression. Altogether, the results of this study suggest that amsacrine triggers apoptosis in K562 cells by inhibiting BCL2L1 expression through the SIDT2/NOX4/ERK-mediated downregulation of HuR. Furthermore, a similar pathway also explains the cytotoxicity of amsacrine in CML MEG-01 and KU812 cells.",2023
37424800,THOC2 expression and its impact on 5-fluorouracil resistance in glioblastoma multiforme.,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. While 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has not been widely employed in GBM therapy, emerging research indicates its potential for effectiveness when combined with advanced drug delivery systems to improve its transport to brain tumors. This study aims to investigate the role of THOC2 expression in 5-FU resistance in GBM cell lines. We evaluated diverse GBM cell lines and primary glioma cells for 5-FU sensitivity, cell doubling times, and gene expression. We observed a significant correlation between THOC2 expression and 5-FU resistance. To further investigate this correlation, we selected five GBM cell lines and developed 5-FU resistant GBM cells, including T98FR cells, through long-term 5-FU treatment. In 5-FU challenged cells, THOC2 expression was upregulated, with the highest increase in T98FR cells. THOC2 knockdown in T98FR cells reduced 5-FU IC50 values, confirming its role in 5-FU resistance. In a mouse xenograft model, THOC2 knockdown attenuated tumor growth and extended survival duration after 5-FU treatment. RNA sequencing identified differentially expressed genes and alternative splicing variants in T98FR/shTHOC2 cells. THOC2 knockdown altered Bcl-x splicing, increasing pro-apoptotic Bcl-xS expression, and impaired cell adhesion and migration by reducing L1CAM expression. These results suggest that THOC2 plays a crucial role in 5-FU resistance in GBM and that targeting THOC2 expression could be a potential therapeutic strategy for improving the efficacy of 5-FU-based combination therapies in GBM patients.",2023
37371456,Bcl-xL Is Spontaneously Inserted into Preassembled Nanodiscs and Stimulates Bax Insertion in a Cell-Free Protein Synthesis System.,"The antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL is a major regulator of cell death and survival, but many aspects of its functions remain elusive. It is mostly localized in the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) owing to its C-terminal hydrophobic α-helix. In order to gain further information about its membrane organization, we set up a model system combining cell-free protein synthesis and nanodisc insertion. We found that, contrary to its proapoptotic partner Bax, neosynthesized Bcl-xL was spontaneously inserted into nanodiscs. The deletion of the C-terminal α-helix of Bcl-xL prevented nanodisc insertion. We also found that nanodisc insertion protected Bcl-xL against the proteolysis of the 13 C-terminal residues that occurs during expression of Bcl-xL as a soluble protein in ",2023
37271936,Anti-apoptotic protein BCL-XL as a therapeutic vulnerability in gastric cancer.,"New therapeutic targets are needed to improve the outcomes for gastric cancer (GC) patients with advanced disease. Evasion of programmed cell death (apoptosis) is a hallmark of cancer cells and direct induction of apoptosis by targeting the pro-survival BCL2 family proteins represents a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning cancer cell survival could provide a molecular basis for potential therapeutic interventions.",2023
37268395,Targeting KRAS in pancreatic cancer: Emerging therapeutic strategies.,"KRAS, a predominant member of the RAS family, is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human pancreatic cancer (∼95% of cases). Mutations in KRAS lead to its constitutive activation and activation of its downstream signaling pathways such as RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR that promote cell proliferation and provide apoptosis evasion capabilities to cancer cells. KRAS had been considered 'undruggable' until the discovery of the first covalent inhibitor targeting the G12C mutation. While G12C mutations are frequently found in non-small cell lung cancer, these are relatively rare in pancreatic cancer. On the other hand, pancreatic cancer harbors other KRAS mutations such as G12D and G12V. The inhibitors targeting G12D mutation (such as MRTX1133) have been recently developed, whereas those targeting other mutations are still lacking. Unfortunately, KRAS inhibitor monotherapy-associated resistance hinders their therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, various combination strategies have been tested and some yielded promising results, such as combinations with receptor tyrosine kinase, SHP2, or SOS1 inhibitors. In addition, we recently demonstrated that the combination of sotorasib with DT2216 (a BCL-X",2023
37267704,Burn-Induced Apoptosis in the Livers of Aged Mice Is Associated With Caspase Cleavage of Bcl-xL.,"Older adult burn victims have poorer outcomes than younger burn victims. The liver is critical for the recovery of patients with burns. Postburn hepatic apoptosis in young individuals compromises liver integrity; however, this pathway has not yet been studied in older individuals. Because aged animals with burns suffer significant liver damage, we hypothesized that apoptosis is altered in these animals and may affect liver function. Understanding postburn hepatic apoptosis and its effects on liver function in aged animals may help improve outcomes in older patients.",2023

37103372,Marine Polyether Phycotoxin Palytoxin Induces Apoptotic Cell Death via Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 Downregulation.,"Palytoxin is considered one of the most potent biotoxins. As palytoxin-induced cancer cell death mechanisms remain to be elucidated, we investigated this effect on various leukemia and solid tumor cell lines at low picomolar concentrations. As palytoxin did not affect the viability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors and did not create systemic toxicity in zebrafish, we confirmed excellent differential toxicity. Cell death was characterized by a multi-parametric approach involving the detection of nuclear condensation and caspase activation assays. zVAD-sensitive apoptotic cell death was concomitant with a dose-dependent downregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL. Proteasome inhibitor MG-132 prevented the proteolysis of Mcl-1, whereas the three major proteasomal enzymatic activities were upregulated by palytoxin. Palytoxin-induced dephosphorylation of Bcl-2 further exacerbated the proapoptotic effect of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL degradation in a range of leukemia cell lines. As okadaic acid rescued cell death triggered by palytoxin, protein phosphatase (PP)2A was involved in Bcl-2 dephosphorylation and induction of apoptosis by palytoxin. At a translational level, palytoxin abrogated the colony formation capacity of leukemia cell types. Moreover, palytoxin abrogated tumor formation in a zebrafish xenograft assay at concentrations between 10 and 30 pM. Altogether, we provide evidence of the role of palytoxin as a very potent and promising anti-leukemic agent, acting at low picomolar concentrations in cellulo and in vivo.",2023

Its dysregulation and altered ratio of splicing variants associate with pathologies. However, isoform-specific loss-of-function analysis of BCL2L1 remains unexplored. Here we show the functional impact of genetically inhibiting Bcl-x short-isoform (Bcl-xS) ",2023
36997643,Mutual induced-fit mechanism drives binding between intrinsically disordered Bim and cryptic binding site of Bcl-xL.,"The intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of Bim binds to the flexible cryptic site of Bcl-xL, a pro-survival protein involved in cancer progression that plays an important role in initiating apoptosis. However, their binding mechanism has not yet been elucidated. We have applied our dynamic docking protocol, which correctly reproduced both the IDR properties of Bim and the native bound configuration, as well as suggesting other stable/meta-stable binding configurations and revealed the binding pathway. Although the cryptic site of Bcl-xL is predominantly in a closed conformation, initial binding of Bim in an encounter configuration leads to mutual induced-fit binding, where both molecules adapt to each other; Bcl-xL transitions to an open state as Bim folds from a disordered to an α-helical conformation while the two molecules bind each other. Finally, our data provides new avenues to develop novel drugs by targeting newly discovered stable conformations of Bcl-xL.",2023
36997005,Maleimide constrained BAD BH3 domain peptides as BCL-x,"Development of protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors remains a major challenge. A significant number of PPIs are mediated by helical recognition epitopes; although peptides derived from such epitopes are attractive templates for inhibitor design, they may not readily adopt a bioactive conformation, are susceptible to proteolysis and rarely elicit optimal cell uptake properties. Constraining peptides has therefore emerged as a useful method to mitigate against these liabilities in the development of PPI inhibitors. Building on our recently reported method for constraining peptides by reaction of dibromomaleimide derivatives with two cysteines positioned in an i and i + 4 relationship, in this study, we showcase the power of the method for rapid identification of ideal constraining positions using a maleimide-staple scan based on a 19-mer sequence derived from the BAD BH3 domain. We found that the maleimide constraint had little or a detrimental impact on helicity and potency in most sequences, but successfully identified i, i + 4 positions where the maleimide constraint was tolerated. Analyses using modelling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that the inactive constrained peptides likely lose interactions with the protein as a result of introducing the constraint.",2023
36902436,Venetoclax-Resistant T-ALL Cells Display Distinct Cancer Stem Cell Signatures and Enrichment of Cytokine Signaling.,"Therapy resistance remains one of the major challenges for cancer treatment that largely limits treatment benefits and patient survival. The underlying mechanisms that lead to therapy resistance are highly complicated because of the specificity to the cancer subtype and therapy. The expression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 has been shown to be deregulated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), where different T-ALL cells display a differential response to the BCL2-specific inhibitor venetoclax. In this study, we observed that the expression of anti-apoptotic BCL2 family genes, such as ",2023
36869126,Serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1) promotes EGFR-TKI resistance by enhancing GSK3β Ser9 autophosphorylation independent of its kinase activity in non-small-cell lung cancer.,"Resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is a major challenge for clinicians and patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1) is a key oncoprotein in the EGFR/AKT pathway that participates in tumorigenesis. We found that high SRPK1 expression was significantly associated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced NSCLC undergoing gefitinib treatment. Both in vitro and in vivo assays suggested that SRPK1 reduced the ability of gefitinib to induce apoptosis in sensitive NSCLC cells independently of its kinase activity. Moreover, SRPK1 facilitated binding between LEF1, β-catenin and the EGFR promoter region to increase EGFR expression and promote the accumulation and phosphorylation of membrane EGFR. Furthermore, we verified that the SRPK1 spacer domain bound to GSK3β and enhanced its autophosphorylation at Ser9 to activate the Wnt pathway, thereby promoting the expression of Wnt target genes such as Bcl-X. The correlation between SRPK1 and EGFR expression was confirmed in patients. In brief, our research suggested that the SRPK1/GSK3β axis promotes gefitinib resistance by activating the Wnt pathway and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for overcoming gefitinib resistance in NSCLC.",2023
36765039,TRAF4-mediated ubiquitination-dependent activation of JNK/Bcl-xL drives radioresistance.,"The E3 ligase TNF receptor-associated factor 4 (TRAF4) is upregulated and closely associated with tumorigenesis and the progression of multiple human malignancies. However, its effect on radiosensitivity in colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been elucidated. The present study found that TRAF4 was significantly increased in CRC clinical tumor samples. Depletion of TRAF4 impaired the malignant phenotype of CRC cells and sensitized irradiation-induced cell death. Irradiation activated the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs)/c-Jun signaling via increasing JNKs K63-linked ubiquitination and phosphorylation. Furthermore, c-Jun activation triggered the transcription of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL, thus contributing to the radioresistance of CRC cells. TRAF4 was positively correlated with c-Jun and Bcl-xL, and blocking TRAF4 or inhibiting Bcl-xL with inhibitor markedly promoted ionizing radiation (IR)-induced intrinsic apoptosis and sensitized CRC cells to radiotherapy in vitro and in vivo. Our findings illustrate a potential mechanism of radioresistance, emphasizing the clinical value of targeting the TRAF4/Bcl-xL axis in CRC therapy.",2023
36706751,Peptides from human BNIP5 and PXT1 and non-native binders of pro-apoptotic BAK can directly activate or inhibit BAK-mediated membrane permeabilization.,"Apoptosis is important for development and tissue homeostasis, and its dysregulation can lead to diseases, including cancer. As an apoptotic effector, BAK undergoes conformational changes that promote mitochondrial outer membrane disruption, leading to cell death. This is termed ""activation"" and can be induced by peptides from the human proteins BID, BIM, and PUMA. To identify additional peptides that can regulate BAK, we used computational protein design, yeast surface display screening, and structure-based energy scoring to identify 10 diverse new binders. We discovered peptides from the human proteins BNIP5 and PXT1 and three non-native peptides that activate BAK in liposome assays and induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Crystal structures and binding studies reveal a high degree of similarity among peptide activators and inhibitors, ruling out a simple function-determining property. Our results shed light on the vast peptide sequence space that can regulate BAK function and will guide the design of BAK-modulating tools and therapeutics.",2023

36621626,Combined inhibition of aurora kinases and Bcl-xL induces apoptosis through select BH3-only proteins.,"Aurora kinases (AURKs) are mitotic kinases important for regulating cell cycle progression. Small-molecule inhibitors of AURK have shown promising antitumor effects in multiple cancers; however, the utility of these inhibitors as inducers of cancer cell death has thus far been limited. Here, we examined the role of the Bcl-2 family proteins in AURK inhibition-induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells. We found that alisertib and danusertib, two small-molecule inhibitors of AURK, are inefficient inducers of apoptosis in HCT116 and DLD-1 colon cancer cells, the survival of which requires at least one of the two antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. We further identified Bcl-xL as a major suppressor of alisertib- or danusertib-induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells. We demonstrate that combination of a Bcl-2 homology (BH)3-mimetic inhibitor (ABT-737), a selective inhibitor of Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Bcl-w, with alisertib or danusertib potently induces apoptosis through the Bcl-2 family effector protein Bax. In addition, we identified Bid, Puma, and Noxa, three BH3-only proteins of the Bcl-2 family, as mediators of alisertib-ABT-737-induced apoptosis. We show while Noxa promotes apoptosis by constitutively sequestering Mcl-1, Puma becomes associated with Mcl-1 upon alisertib treatment. On the other hand, we found that alisertib treatment causes activation of caspase-2, which promotes apoptosis by cleaving Bid into truncated Bid, a suppressor of both Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. Together, these results define the Bcl-2 protein network critically involved in AURK inhibitor-induced apoptosis and suggest that BH3-mimetics targeting Bcl-xL may help overcome resistance to AURK inhibitors in cancer cells.",2023
36603764,Endoplasmic reticulum protein BIK binds to and inhibits mitochondria-localized antiapoptotic proteins.,"The proapoptotic BCL-2 homology (BH3)-only endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein BCL-2 interacting killer (BIK) positively regulates mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, the point of no return in apoptosis. It is generally accepted that BIK functions at a distance from mitochondria by binding and sequestering antiapoptotic proteins at the ER, thereby promoting ER calcium release. Although BIK is predominantly localized to the ER, we detect by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy-FRET microscopy, BH3 region-dependent direct binding between BIK and mitochondria-localized chimeric mutants of the antiapoptotic proteins BCL-XL and BCL-2 in both baby mouse kidney (BMK) and MCF-7 cells. Direct binding was accompanied by cell type-specific differential relocalization in response to coexpression of either BIK or one of its target binding partners, BCL-XL, when coexpressed in cells. In BMK cells with genetic deletion of both BAX and BAK (BMK-double KO), our data suggest that a fraction of BIK protein moves toward mitochondria in response to the expression of a mitochondria-localized BCL-XL mutant. In contrast, in MCF-7 cells, our data suggest that BIK is localized at both ER and mitochondria-associated ER membranes and binds to the mitochondria-localized BCL-XL mutant via relocalization of BCL-XL to ER and mitochondria-associated ER membrane. Rather than functioning at a distance, our data suggest that BIK initiates mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization via direct interactions with ER and mitochondria-localized antiapoptotic proteins, which occur via ER-mitochondria contact sites, and/or by relocalization of either BIK or antiapoptotic proteins in cells.",2023
36597005,Effect of UV Stress on the Structure and Function of Pro-apoptotic Bid and Anti-apoptotic Bcl-xl proteins.,"Ultraviolet C (UV-C) radiation induces apoptosis in mammalian cells via the mitochondrion-mediated pathway. The Bcl-2 family of proteins are the regulators of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis and appears responsive to UV-C radiation. It is unknown how the structure and, effectively, the function of these proteins are directly impacted by UV-C exposure. Here, we present the effect of UV-C irradiation on the structure and function of pro-apoptotic Bid-FL and anti-apoptotic Bcl-xlΔC proteins. Using a variety of biophysical tools, we show that, following UV-C irradiation, the structures of Bcl-xlΔC and Bid-FL are irreversibly altered. Bcl-xLΔC is found to be more sensitive to UV stress than Bid-FL Interestingly, UV-C exposure shows dramatic chemical shift perturbations in consequence of dramatic structural perturbations (α-helix to β-sheet) in the BH3- binding region, a crucial segment of Bcl-xlΔC. Furter it has been shown that UV-exposed Bcl-xlΔC has reduced efficacy of its interactions with pro-apoptotic tBid.",2023
36586532,Bad is essential for Bcl-xL-enhanced Bax shuttling between mitochondria and cytosol.,"Although Bcl-xL has been shown to retrotranslocate Bax from mitochondria to cytosol, other studies have found that Bcl-xL also stabilizes the mitochondrial localization of Bax. It is still unclear what causes the difference in Bcl-xL-regulated Bax localization. Bad, a BH3-only protein with a high affinity for Bcl-xL, may play an important role in Bcl-xL-regulated Bax shuttling. Here, we found that Bcl-xL enhanced both translocalization and retrotranslocation of mitochondrial Bax, as evidenced by quantitative co-localization, western blots and fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) analyses. Notably, Bad knockdown prevented Bcl-xL-mediated Bax retrotranslocation, indicating Bad was essential for this process. Quantitative fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging in living cells and co-immunoprecipitation analyses showed that the interaction of Bcl-xL with Bad was stronger than that with Bax. The Bad mimetic ABT-737 dissociated Bax from Bcl-xL on isolated mitochondria, suggesting that mitochondrial Bax was directly liberated to cytosol due to Bad binding to Bcl-xL. In addition, MK-2206, an Akt inhibitor, decreased Bad phosphorylation while increasing cytosolic Bax proportion. Our data firmly demonstrate a notion that Bad binds to mitochondrial Bcl-xL to release Bax, resulting in retrotranslocation of Bax to cytosol, and that the amount of Bad involved is regulated by Akt signaling.",2023
36543138,BCL-xL inhibition potentiates cancer therapies by redirecting the outcome of p53 activation from senescence to apoptosis.,"Cancer therapies trigger diverse cellular responses, ranging from apoptotic death to acquisition of persistent therapy-refractory states such as senescence. Tipping the balance toward apoptosis could improve treatment outcomes regardless of therapeutic agent or malignancy. We find that inhibition of the mitochondrial protein BCL-xL increases the propensity of cancer cells to die after treatment with a broad array of oncology drugs, including mitotic inhibitors and chemotherapy. Functional precision oncology and omics analyses suggest that BCL-xL inhibition redirects the outcome of p53 transcriptional response from senescence to apoptosis, which likely occurs via caspase-dependent down-modulation of p21 and downstream cytostatic proteins. Consequently, addition of a BCL-2/xL inhibitor strongly improves melanoma response to the senescence-inducing drug targeting mitotic kinase Aurora kinase A (AURKA) in mice and patient-derived organoids. This study shows a crosstalk between the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and cell cycle regulation that can be targeted to augment therapeutic efficacy in cancers with wild-type p53.",2022

While drug combinations are intended to be beneficial, the consequence of CYP-dependent drug interactions on apoptotic protein levels and mitochondrial function in the epileptic brain remains unclear.

To identify effective drugs, phenotypic drug screening has proven to be a powerful method, but achievable throughput in mouse xenografts, the preclinical Ewing sarcoma standard model, is limited. Here, we explored the use of xenografts in zebrafish for high-throughput drug screening to discover new combination therapies for Ewing sarcoma. We subjected xenografts in zebrafish larvae to high-content imaging and subsequent automated tumor size analysis to screen single agents and compound combinations. We identified three drug combinations effective against Ewing sarcoma cells: Irinotecan combined with either an MCL-1 or an BCL-X",2023

Development of ORCs involved culturing tumors ex vivo on collagen beds (boats) with grid supports to maintain their morphological structure. The ORCs were developed from patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of colon cancers excised from immune-deficient mice (NOD/SCID/IL2Rgamma",2022
36422202,Bioinformatic Analysis of the BCL-xL/BCL2L1 Interactome in Patients with Pancreatic Cancer.,"Objectives: The aim of the present study was to analyze the differential gene expression of BCL-xL/BCL2L and the associated genetic, molecular, and biologic functions in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by employing advanced bioinformatics to investigate potential candidate genes implicated in the pathogenesis of PDAC. Materials and Methods: Bioinformatic techniques were employed to build the gene network of BCL-xL, to assess the translational profile of BCL-xL in PDAC, assess its role in predicting PDAC, and investigate the associated biologic functions and the regulating miRNA families. Results: Microarray data extracted from one dataset was incorporated, including 130 samples (PDAC: 69; Control: 61). In addition, the expression level of BCL-xL was higher in PDAC compared to control samples (p < 0.001). Furthermore, BCL-xL demonstrated excellent discrimination (AUC: 0.83 [95% Confidence Intervals: 0.76, 0.90]; p < 0.001) and calibration (R squared: 0.31) traits for PDAC. A gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrated the molecular functions and miRNA families (hsa-miR-4804-5p, hsa-miR-4776-5p, hsa-miR-6770-3p, hsa-miR-3619-3p, and hsa-miR-7152-3p) related to BCL-xL. Conclusions: The current findings unveil the biological implications of BCL-xL in PDAC and the related molecular functions and miRNA families.",2022

DT2216 is a PROteolysis-TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) that degrades BCL-XL specifically and is in phase 1 trials.

36332463,Bone marrow microenvironment- induced regulation of Bcl-2 family members in multiple myeloma (MM): Therapeutic implications.,"In Multiple Myeloma (MM) the finely tuned homeostasis of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment is disrupted. Evasion of programmed cell death (apoptosis) represents a hallmark of cancer. Besides genetic aberrations, the supportive and protective MM BM milieu, which is constituted by cytokines and growth factors, intercellular and cell: extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions and exosomes, in particular, plays a key role in the abundance of pro-survival members of the Bcl-2 family (i.e., Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL) in tumor cells. Moreover, microenvironmental cues have also an impact on stability- regulating post-translational modifications of anti-apoptotic proteins including de/phosphorylation, polyubiquitination; on their intracellular binding affinities, and localization. Advances of our molecular knowledge on the escape of cancer cells from apoptosis have informed the development of a new class of small molecules that mimic the action of BH3-only proteins. Indeed, approaches to directly target anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members are among today's most promising therapeutic strategies and BH3-mimetics (i.e., venetoclax) are currently revolutionizing not only the treatment of CLL and AML, but also hold great therapeutic promise in MM. Furthermore, approaches that activate apoptotic pathways indirectly via modification of the tumor microenvironment have already entered clinical practice. The present review article will summarize our up-to-date knowledge on molecular mechanisms by which the MM BM microenvironment, cytokines, and growth factors in particular, mediates tumor cell evasion from apoptosis. Moreover, it will discuss some of the most promising science- derived therapeutic strategies to overcome Bcl-2- mediated tumor cell survival in order to further improve MM patient outcome.",2023
36326498,Ubiquitination of SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a Prevents Cell Death Induced by Recruiting BclXL To Activate ER Stress.,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has emerged in the last 2 years. The accessory protein ORF7a has been proposed as an immunomodulating factor that can cause dramatic inflammatory responses, but it is unknown how ORF7a interacts with host cells. We show that ORF7a induces cell apoptosis by recruiting the prosurvival factor BclXL to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the exposed C-terminal residues Lys117 and Lys119. Simultaneously, ORF7a activates ER stress via the PERK-elF2α-CHOP pathway and inhibits the expression of endogenous BclXL, resulting in enhanced cell apoptosis. Ubiquitination of ORF7a interrupts the interaction with BclXL in the ER and weakens the activation of ER stress, which to some extent rescues the cells. Our work demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a hires antiapoptosis protein and aggregates on the ER, resulting in ER stress and apoptosis initiation. On the other hand, ORF7a utilizes the ubiquitin system to impede and escape host elimination, providing a promising potential target for developing strategies for minimizing the COVID-19 pandemic.

36293331,Sensitivity of Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma Cells to the Mcl-1 Inhibitor S63845 Correlates with the Lack of Bcl-w Expression.,"Long-term, curative treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) remains a major challenge. Therapy resistance is often based on apoptosis deficiency, and may depend on antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-x",2022
36279564,Bcl-xL Is a Key Mediator of Apoptosis Following KRASG12C Inhibition in KRASG12C-mutant Colorectal Cancer.,"Novel covalent inhibitors of KRASG12C have shown limited response rates in patients with KRASG12C-mutant (MT) colorectal cancer. Thus, novel KRASG12C inhibitor combination strategies that can achieve deep and durable responses are needed. Small-molecule KRASG12C inhibitors AZ'1569 and AZ'8037 were used. To identify novel candidate combination strategies for AZ'1569, we performed RNA sequencing, siRNA, and high-throughput drug screening. Top hits were validated in a panel of KRASG12CMT colorectal cancer cells and in vivo. AZ'1569-resistant colorectal cancer cells were generated and characterized. We found that response to AZ'1569 was heterogeneous across the KRASG12CMT models. AZ'1569 was ineffective at inducing apoptosis when used as a single agent or combined with chemotherapy or agents targeting the EGFR/KRAS/AKT axis. Using a systems biology approach, we identified the antiapoptotic BH3-family member BCL2L1/Bcl-xL as a top hit mediating resistance to AZ'1569. Further analyses identified acute increases in the proapoptotic protein BIM following AZ'1569 treatment. ABT-263 (navitoclax), a pharmacologic Bcl-2 family inhibitor that blocks the ability of Bcl-xL to bind and inhibit BIM, led to dramatic and universal apoptosis when combined with AZ'1569. Furthermore, this combination also resulted in dramatically attenuated tumor growth in KRASG12CMT xenografts. Finally, AZ'1569-resistant cells showed amplification of KRASG12C, EphA2/c-MET activation, increased proinflammatory chemokine profile and cross-resistance to several targeted agents. Importantly, KRAS amplification and AZ'1569 resistance were reversible upon drug withdrawal, arguing strongly for the use of drug holidays in the case of KRAS amplification. Taken together, combinatorial targeting of Bcl-xL and KRASG12C is highly effective, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with KRASG12CMT colorectal cancer.",2023
36273072,Noxa and Mcl-1 expression influence the sensitivity to BH3-mimetics that target Bcl-xL in patient-derived glioma stem cells.,"The recurrence of Glioblastoma is partly attributed to the highly resistant subpopulation of glioma stem cells. A novel therapeutic approach focuses on restoring apoptotic programs in these cancer stem cells, as they are often deregulated. BH3-mimetics, targeting anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, are emerging as promising compounds to sensitize cancer cells to antineoplastic treatments. Herein, we determined that the most abundantly expressed anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, are the most relevant in regulating patient-derived glioma stem cell survival. We exposed these cells to routinely used chemotherapeutic drugs and BH3-mimetics (ABT-263, WEHI-539, and S63845). We observed that the combination of BH3-mimetics targeting Bcl-xL with chemotherapeutic agents caused a marked increase in cell death and that this sensitivity to Bcl-xL inhibition correlated with Noxa expression levels. Interestingly, whereas co-targeting Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 led to massive cell death in all tested cell lines, down-regulation of Noxa promoted cell survival only in cell lines expressing higher levels of this BH3-only. Therefore, in glioma stem cells, the efficacy of Bcl-xL inhibition is closely associated with Mcl-1 activity and Noxa expression. Hence, a potentially effective strategy would consist of combining Bcl-xL inhibitors with chemotherapeutic agents capable of inducing Noxa, taking advantage of this pro-apoptotic factor.",2022
36126466,Dual inhibition of BCL2L1 and MCL1 is highly effective against RET fusion-positive or MET exon 14 skipping mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma cells.,"Non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs), especially lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs), harbor several driver mutations against which highly effective tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are available. Although TKIs are generally effective against certain NSCLCs, primary or acquired resistance almost always develops. Driver mutations include RET fusion (∼1-2% of NSCLC cases) and MET exon 14 skipping mutation (METΔex14; ∼3-4%). Surprisingly, the LUAD cell line LC-2/ad with CCDC6-RET fusion thrived independently of RET signaling, and Hs-746T cells harboring METΔex14 plus amplification survived MET silencing. However, these two cell lines were highly sensitive to dual silencing of the representative anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members BCL2L1 and MCL1, undergoing extensive apoptosis in monolayer or 3D on-top culture systems. Moreover, we found that most LUAD cell lines and tissues expressed high levels of BCL2L1 and MCL1 mRNA but extremely low levels of BCL2. Together, these findings suggest that inhibiting BCL2L1 plus MCL1 may represent a new approach to treating LUAD cells irrespective of their driver mutations.",2022
36084554,Fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor erdafitinib promotes Mcl-1 degradation and synergistically induces apoptosis with Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 inhibitor in urothelial cancer cells.,"Metastatic urothelial cancer is a lethal disease. Although recent advances in immunotherapies and targeted therapy against fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)2/3 mutation (erdafitinib) have improved patient survival, there is still a critical need for novel therapeutic strategies for patients who do not benefit from these treatments. Evasion of apoptosis through amplifying anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2) is one mechanism responsible for treatment resistance in urothelial cancers, suggesting that targeting anti-apoptotic proteins may be a possible therapeutic strategy for urothelial cancers. Here, we showed that erdafitinib increased Mcl-1 degradation mainly through previously unknown mechanisms and synergized with a BH3 mimetic drug targeting Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 to induce apoptosis in FGFR wild-type urothelial cancer cells. Strikingly, clinical sequencing data showed amplification of MCL1 or BCL2L1 (encoding Bcl-xL) in subsets of FGFR mutation-negative bladder cancer tissues. In conclusion, these findings suggest that exploiting apoptosis pathways may be a promising treatment strategy for patients with FGFR wild-type metastatic urothelial cancer with Mcl-1 or Bcl-xL overexpression.",2022
36076608,Palbociclib promotes the antitumor activity of Venetoclax plus Azacitidine against acute myeloid leukemia.,"Around 70 % of patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) survive less than 5 years due to drug resistance and disease relapse. Consequently, improved clinical treatments are urgently needed. Some but not all AML patients benefit from the combination of the BCL-2 inhibitor Venetoclax with the hypomethylation agent Azacitidine. Here we investigated the utility of employing the cyclin dependent kinase (CDK6) inhibitor Palbociclib to improve the efficacy of Venetoclax/Azacitidine combination therapy. Our analysis of publicly available RNA sequencing datasets showed CDK6 was highly expressed in the major acute forms of leukemia including AML. Consistently, using qPCR and flow cytometry we found that CDK6 was overexpressed in bone marrow mononuclear cells from AML patients compared to healthy controls. Subsequent in vitro testing of Palbociclib, Venetoclax and Azacitidine, alone and in combination against CDK6-overexpressing AML cells lines THP-1 and KG-1 and primary AML cells showed that the Palbociclib/Venetoclax/Azacitidine combination improved treatment efficacy compared to Venetoclax/Azacitidine treatment alone. Additional investigations in a subcutaneous KG-1 mouse model showed similarly the three-drug combination produced the most significant reductions in tumor load together with the least amount of spleen infiltration. We established Palbociclib functioned in combination with Venetoclax/Azacitidine by increasing the rates of apoptosis in AML cells. Further investigations revealed that Palbociclib does not affect BCL-2 activity but downregulated the anti-apoptotic proteins MCL-1 and BCL-X",2022

36041325,BID- and BAX-mediated mitochondrial pathway dominates A-1331852-induced apoptosis in senescent A549 cells.,"Recovered senescent tumor cells harbor higher migration and invasion potential, owing to which they play a crucial role in tumor recurrence and drug resistance. The aim of this study was to explore the ability of BH3 mimetics in clearing senescent A549 cells and elucidate their underlying killing mechanism. Doxorubicin-induced cell senescence was determined using augmented senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) staining and increased P16 expression. CCK-8 and crystal violet staining demonstrated that A-1331852, BH3 mimetic, could kill senescent tumor cells without affecting the proliferating cells. A-1331852 induced caspase-dependent senescent cell death accompanied by nuclear concentration, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Most importantly, A-1331852 upregulated the expression of BID and BAX indicating their role in mediating A-1331852-induced apoptosis in senescent A549 cells. The results of fluorescence resonance energy transfer showed that A-1331852 loosened or even released the binding between BCL-xL and tBID, releasing tBID. In addition, A-1331852 also dissociated the binding between BCL-xL and BAX, eventually leading to BAX oligomerization in the mitochondria, and resulting in apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. In conclusion, our data demonstrate for the first time that A-1331852 promotes apoptosis of senescent A549 cells by influencing the interaction between BCL-xL and tBID and that between BCL-xL and BAX.",2022
35988426,"NA1-115-7, from Zygogynum pancheri, is a new selective MCL-1 inhibitor inducing the apoptosis of hematological cancer cells but non-toxic to normal blood cells or cardiomyocytes.","The overexpression of antiapoptotic members (BCL-2, BCL-xL, MCL-1, etc.) of the BCL-2 family contributes to tumor development and resistance to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Synthetic inhibitors targeting these proteins have been developed, and some hematological malignancies are now widely treated with a BCL-2 inhibitor (venetoclax). However, acquired resistance to venetoclax or chemotherapy drugs due to an upregulation of MCL-1 has been observed, rendering MCL-1 an attractive new target for treatment. Six MCL-1 inhibitors (S64315, AZD-5991, AMG-176, AMG-397, ABBV-467 and PRT1419) have been evaluated in clinical trials since 2016, but some were affected by safety issues and none are currently used clinically. There is, therefore, still a need for alternative molecules. We previously described two drimane derivatives as the first covalent BH3 mimetics targeting MCL-1. Here, we described the characterization and biological efficacy of one of these compounds (NA1-115-7), isolated from Zygogynum pancheri, a plant belonging to the Winteraceae family. NA1-115-7 specifically induced the apoptosis of MCL-1-dependent tumor cells, with two hours of treatment sufficient to trigger cell death. The treatment of lymphoma cells with NA1-115-7 stabilized MCL-1, disrupted its interactions with BAK, and rapidly induced apoptosis through a BAK- and BAX-mediated process. Importantly, a similar treatment with NA1-115-7 was not toxic to erythrocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, platelets, or cardiomyocytes. These results highlight the potential of natural products for use as specific BH3 mimetics non-toxic to normal cells, and they suggest that NA1-115-7 may be a promising tool for use in cancer treatment.",2022

35972700,RNA splicing: a dual-edged sword for hepatocellular carcinoma.,"RNA splicing is the fundamental process that brings diversity at the transcriptome and proteome levels. The spliceosome complex regulates minor and major processes of RNA splicing. Aberrant regulation is often associated with different diseases, including diabetes, stroke, hypertension, and cancer. In the majority of cancers, dysregulated alternative RNA splicing (ARS) events directly affect tumor progression, invasiveness, and often lead to poor survival of the patients. Alike the rest of the gastrointestinal malignancies, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which alone contributes to ~ 75% of the liver cancers, a large number of ARS events have been observed, including intron retention, exon skipping, presence of alternative 3'-splice site (3'SS), and alternative 5'-splice site (5'SS). These events are reported in spliceosome and non-spliceosome complexes genes. Molecules such as MCL1, Bcl-X, and BCL2 in different isoforms can behave as anti-apoptotic or pro-apoptotic, making the spliceosome complex a dual-edged sword. The anti-apoptotic isoforms of such molecules bring in resistance to chemotherapy or cornerstone drugs. However, in contrast, multiple malignant tumors, including HCC that target the pro-apoptotic favoring isoforms/variants favor apoptotic induction and make chemotherapy effective. Herein, we discuss different splicing events, aberrations, and antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) in modulating RNA splicing in HCC tumorigenesis with a possible therapeutic outcome.",2022
35964379,Structural and biochemical analyses of Bcl-xL in complex with the BH3 domain of peroxisomal testis-specific 1.,"Antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) proteins suppress apoptosis by interacting with proapoptotic regulators. They commonly contain a hydrophobic groove where the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain of Bcl-2 family members or BH3 domain-containing non-Bcl-2 family proteins can be accommodated. Peroxisomal testis-specific 1 (Pxt1) was previously identified as a male germ cell-specific protein whose overexpression causes germ cell apoptosis and infertility in male mice. Sequence and biochemical analyses also showed that human Pxt1, which is composed of 134 amino acids and is longer than mouse Pxt1 consisting of only 51 amino acids, has a BH3 domain that interacts with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of Bcl-xL bound to the human Pxt1 BH3 domain. The five BH3 consensus residues are well conserved in the human Pxt1 BH3 domain and make a critical contribution to the complex formation in a canonical manner. Structural and biochemical analyses also demonstrated that Bcl-xL interacts with the BH3 domain of human Pxt1 but not with that of mouse Pxt1, and that residues 76-83 of human Pxt1, absent in mouse Pxt1, play a pivotal role in the intermolecular binding to Bcl-xL. While Bcl-xL consistently colocalized with human Pxt1 in mitochondria, it did not do so with mouse Pxt1, when expressed in HeLa cells. Collectively, these data verified that human and mouse Pxt1 differ in their binding ability to the antiapoptotic regulator Bcl-xL, which might affect their functionality in controlling apoptosis.",2022
35921705,"Mivebresib synergized with PZ703b, a novel Bcl-xl PROTAC degrader, induces apoptosis in bladder cancer cells via the mitochondrial pathway.","Bladder cancer is a common urinary cancer that still lacks effective treatments. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of BET inhibitor, mivebresib, in combination with PZ703b, a Bcl-xl PROTAC, on apoptosis in bladder cancer cells. The results revealed that mivebresib and PZ703b synergistically decreased the viabilities of bladder cancer cells. Co-treatment of mivebresib and PZ703b induced apoptosis in bladder cancer cells via the mitochondrial pathway in a caspase-dependent manner. Mechanistically, mivebresib and PZ703b treatment inhibited the expression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xl, accompanied by upregulation of Bim. Hence, co-treatment of mivebresib and PZ703b rebalanced the level of pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins in cells. Further investigations showed that forced expression of Mcl-1 or Bcl-xl markedly protected bladder cancer cells from apoptosis induced by combination treatment of mivebresib and PZ703b. In addition, knockdown of Bim also inhibited the cell death induced by mivebresib/PZ703b in bladder cancer cells. In summary, our findings reveal that the combination treatment of mivebresib and PZ703b represents a novel promising strategy to treat bladder cancer.",2022

35791860,Selectivity mechanism of BCL-XL/2 inhibition through ,"The BCL-XL protein is among the most important members of the anti-apoptotic subfamily of the BCL-2 protein family, and is currently a promising new target for anti-tumor drug research. However, the BCL-XL/2 proteins have similar structures and functions, which could lead to undesirable side effects because of inhibitors that can bind to both BCL-XL and BCL-2. Therefore, it is crucial to expound on the structural basis of the selective mechanism towards BCL-XL/2 inhibition. In the current study, we employed hybrid computational methods including molecular docking and dynamics simulation, MM/GBSA energy calculation, alanine scanning mutagenesis and Hirshfeld surface analysis to comprehensively reveal the selectivity mechanism towards BCL-XL/2 from multiple perspectives, revealing the significant effects of the BCL-XL residues SER106 and LEU108 as well as the BCL-2 residue ASP103 on the inhibitory selectivity. Overall, our findings provide useful references for the rational design of BCL-XL/2 selective inhibitors with better affinity.",2022

35617726,In silico SELEX screening and statistical analysis of newly designed 5mer peptide-aptamers as Bcl-xl inhibitors using the Taguchi method.,"Drug development for cancer treatment is a complex process that requires special efforts. Targeting crucial proteins is the most essential purpose of drug design in cancers. Bcl-xl is an anti-apoptotic protein that binds to pro-apoptotic proteins and interrupts their signals. Pro-apoptotic Bcl-xl effectors are short BH3 sequences that form an alpha helix and bind to anti-apoptotic proteins to inhibit their activity. Computational systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is an exclusive approach for developing peptide aptamers as potential effectors. Here, the amino acids with a high tendency for constructing an alpha-helical structure were selected. Due to the enormous number of pentapeptides, Taguchi method was used to study a selected number of peptides. The binding affinity of the peptides to Bcl-xl was assessed using molecular docking, and after analysis of the obtained results, a final set of optimized peptides was arranged and constructed. For a better comparison, three chemical compounds with approved anti-Bcl-xl activity were selected for comparison with the top-ranked 5mer peptides. The optimized peptides showed considerable binding affinity to Bcl-xl. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation indicated that the designed peptide (PO5) could create considerable interactions with the BH3 domain of Bcl-xl. The MM/GBSA calculations revealed that these interactions were even stronger than those created by chemical compounds. In silico SELEX is a novel approach to design and evaluate peptide-aptamers. The experimental design improves the SELEX process considerably. Finally, PO5 could be considered a potential inhibitor of Bcl-xl and a potential candidate for cancer treatment.",2022
35583342,Single-Molecule Sensing of an Anticancer Therapeutic Protein-Protein Interaction Using the Chemically Modified OmpG Nanopore.,"Nanopore sensors are a highly attractive platform for single-molecule sensing for sequencing, disease diagnostics, and drug screening. Outer membrane protein G (OmpG) nanopores have advantages for single-molecule sensing owing to their rigid monomeric structure, which comprises seven flexible loops, providing distinct gating patterns upon analyte binding. Blocking of the protein-protein interaction between B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xL) and the BH3 domain of Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Bak-BH3) has been reported as a promising strategy for anticancer therapy. Here, we characterized the interaction between Bcl-xL and Bak-BH3 as well as its inhibition by a small-molecule inhibitor using click chemistry-based Bak-BH3 peptide-conjugated OmpG nanopores. The binding of Bcl-xL to Bak-BH3 generated characteristic gating signals involving significant changes in the amplitudes of noise and gating parameters such as gating frequency, open probability, and durations of open and closed states. Notably, specific inhibition of Bcl-xL by the small-molecule antagonist, ABT-737, led to the recovery of the noise and gating parameters. Collectively, these results revealed that the chemically modified OmpG nanopore can serve as a valuable sensor platform for ultrasensitive, rapid, and single-molecule-based drug screening against protein-protein interactions, which are therapeutic targets for various diseases.",2022

We identified novel Bcl-2/Mcl-1 dual inhibitors with indole scaffold by the optimization of hit 1. Structure modification against several moieties including hydrophobic fragment, side chain and benzoic acid fragment was conducted and the structure-activity relationship was analyzed. The representative compound 12f exhibited sub-micromolar binding affinities to Bcl-2/Mcl-1 without binding affinity to Bcl-X",2022
35473984,Increased apoptotic sensitivity of glioblastoma enables therapeutic targeting by BH3-mimetics.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent malignant primary brain tumour in adults. GBM typically has a poor prognosis, mainly due to a lack of effective treatment options leading to tumour persistence or recurrence. We investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins in GBM. Levels of anti-apoptotic BCL-xL and MCL-1 were consistently increased in GBM compared with non-malignant cells and tissue. Moreover, we found that relative to their differentiated counterparts, patient-derived GBM stem-like cells also displayed higher expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members. High anti-apoptotic BCL-xL and MCL-1 expression correlated with heightened susceptibility of GBM to BCL-2 family protein-targeting BH3-mimetics. This is indicative of increased apoptotic priming. Indeed, GBM displayed an obligate requirement for MCL-1 expression in both tumour development and maintenance. Investigating this apoptotic sensitivity, we found that sequential inhibition of BCL-xL and MCL-1 led to robust anti-tumour responses in vivo, in the absence of overt toxicity. These data demonstrate that BCL-xL and MCL-1 pro-survival function is a fundamental prerequisite for GBM survival that can be therapeutically exploited by BH3-mimetics.",2022

35421634,BAK plays a key role in A-1331852-induced apoptosis in senescent chondrocytes.,"Osteoarthritis occurs when the number of senescent chondrocytes in the joints reaches an intolerable level. The purpose of our study was to explore the therapeutic effect and mechanism of action of A-1331852 in osteoarthritis. Doxorubicin and etoposide were used to induce cell senescence as determined by the cessation of cell proliferation, augmented senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) staining, and increased p53 expression levels. The CCK-8 cytotoxicity assay and SA-β-Gal staining demonstrated that Bcl-xL inhibitors could selectively remove senescent chondrocytes without damaging healthy chondrocytes. A-1331852 induced caspase-dependent death of senescent chondrocytes with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, nuclear concentration, plasma membrane rupture, and PARP cleavage. Most importantly, A-1331852 upregulated BAK expression levels, indicating that BAK plays a key role in the A-1331852-induced apoptosis of senescent chondrocytes. Live-cell fluorescence resonance energy transfer showed that A-1331852 detached the binding of Bcl-xL to BAK and promoted the oligomerization of BAK on the mitochondrial membrane. In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence that A-1331852 selectively promotes apoptosis in senescent chondrocytes by interfering with the interaction between Bcl-xL and BAK.",2022
35388168,What can we learn from mice lacking pro-survival BCL-2 proteins to advance BH3 mimetic drugs for cancer therapy?,"In many human cancers the control of apoptosis is dysregulated, for instance as a result of the overexpression of pro-survival BCL-2 proteins. This promotes tumorigenesis by protecting nascent neoplastic cells from stress and renders malignant cells resistant to anti-cancer agents. Therefore, several BH3 mimetic drugs targeting distinct pro-survival proteins have been developed. The BCL-2 inhibitor Venetoclax/ABT-199, has been approved for treatment of certain blood cancers and tens of thousands of patients have already been treated effectively with this drug. To advance the clinical development of MCL-1 and BCL-XL inhibitors, a more detailed understanding of their distinct and overlapping roles in the survival of malignant as well as non-transformed cells in healthy tissues is required. Here, we discuss similarities and differences in pro-survival BCL-2 protein structure, subcellular localisation and binding affinities to the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family members. We summarise the findings from gene-targeting studies in mice to discuss the specific roles of distinct pro-survival BCL-2 family members during embryogenesis and the survival of non-transformed cells in healthy tissues in adults. Finally, we elaborate how these findings align with or differ from the observations from the clinical development and use of BH3 mimetic drugs targeting different pro-survival BCL-2 proteins.",2022
35362903,Acetic acid triggers cytochrome c release in yeast heterologously expressing human Bax.,"Proteins of the Bcl-2 protein family, including pro-apoptotic Bax and anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL, are critical for mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis regulation. Since yeast lacks obvious orthologs of Bcl-2 family members, heterologous expression of these proteins has been used to investigate their molecular and functional aspects. Active Bax is involved in the formation of mitochondrial outer membrane pores, through which cytochrome c (cyt c) is released, triggering a cascade of downstream apoptotic events. However, when in its inactive form, Bax is largely cytosolic or weakly bound to mitochondria. Given the central role of Bax in apoptosis, studies aiming to understand its regulation are of paramount importance towards its exploitation as a therapeutic target. So far, studies taking advantage of heterologous expression of human Bax in yeast to unveil regulation of Bax activation have relied on the use of artificial mutated or mitochondrial tagged Bax for its activation, rather than the wild type Bax (Bax α). Here, we found that cell death could be triggered in yeast cells heterologoulsy expressing Bax α with concentrations of acetic acid that are not lethal to wild type cells. This was associated with Bax mitochondrial translocation and cyt c release, closely resembling the natural Bax function in the cellular context. This regulated cell death process was reverted by co-expression with Bcl-xL, but not with Bcl-xLΔC, and in the absence of Rim11p, the yeast ortholog of mammalian GSK3β. This novel system mimics human Bax α regulation by GSK3β and can therefore be used as a platform to uncover novel Bax regulators and explore its therapeutic modulation.",2022

35315913,Bcl-xL Enforces a Slow-Cycling State Necessary for Survival in the Nutrient-Deprived Microenvironment of Pancreatic Cancer.,"Solid tumors possess heterogeneous metabolic microenvironments where oxygen and nutrient availability are plentiful (fertile regions) or scarce (arid regions). While cancer cells residing in fertile regions proliferate rapidly, most cancer cells in vivo reside in arid regions and exhibit a slow-cycling state that renders them chemoresistant. Here, we developed an in vitro system enabling systematic comparison between these populations via transcriptome analysis, metabolomic profiling, and whole-genome CRISPR screening. Metabolic deprivation led to pronounced transcriptional and metabolic reprogramming, resulting in decreased anabolic activities and distinct vulnerabilities. Reductions in anabolic, energy-consuming activities, particularly cell proliferation, were not simply byproducts of the metabolic challenge, but rather essential adaptations. Mechanistically, Bcl-xL played a central role in the adaptation to nutrient and oxygen deprivation. In this setting, Bcl-xL protected quiescent cells from the lethal effects of cell-cycle entry in the absence of adequate nutrients. Moreover, inhibition of Bcl-xL combined with traditional chemotherapy had a synergistic antitumor effect that targeted cycling cells. Bcl-xL expression was strongly associated with poor patient survival despite being confined to the slow-cycling fraction of human pancreatic cancer cells. These findings provide a rationale for combining traditional cancer therapies that target rapidly cycling cells with those that target quiescent, chemoresistant cells associated with nutrient and oxygen deprivation.",2022

Due to the extremely serious nature of the disease, it has claimed many lives, with a mortality rate of 3.4% declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 3, 2020. The aim of this study is to gain an understanding of the regulatory nature of the proteins involved in COVID-19 and to explore the possibility that microRNA (miRNA) could become a major component in the decoding of the virus. In the study, we were able to correlate the host protein gene BCL2L1 with miRNA miR-23b via network analysis. MiRNAs have previously been associated with the antiviral properties of various viral diseases, such as enterovirus 71 and hepatitis. They have been reported to act as antiviral regulators, since they are an integral component in the direct regulation of viral genes. MiRNAs are also capable of enabling the virus to avoid the host immune response by suppressing the IFN-α/β signaling pathway or increasing the production of IFN-α/β and as a result, inhibiting the viral infection. Here, we explain and shed light on the various correlations in the miRNA-gene-disease association that are seen in the host proteins of COVID-19.",2022

35140891,Structural insights into apoptotic regulation of human Bfk as a novel Bcl-2 family member.,"Bcl-2 family kin (Bfk), also known as Bcl-2-like 15, plays an essential role in regulating apoptosis by eliciting weak pro-apoptotic responses in the gastrointestinal tract. Human Bfk is a novel Bcl-2 family protein owing to its unique domain composition involving BH2 and BH3. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of apoptosis by Bfk remains unclear. Here, we first report the crystal structure of human full-length Bfk. Surprisingly, the structure of Bfk adopts a canonical Bcl-2 fold but lacks the hydrophobic cleft, which could accommodate a BH3 domain from other Bcl-2 family proteins. Our biophysical interaction analysis proved that the full-length Bfk itself does not interact with multi-domain Bcl-2 family proteins or a BH3-containing peptide. Instead, Bfk is structurally and functionally reminiscent of Bid, a BH3-only protein in the Bcl-2 family, with similar conformations of helices α3-α5 and the specific motif in helix α5. Not only structural analyses of the full-length Bfk but also molecular dynamics simulation suggested that Bfk elicits its pro-apoptotic activity through a Bid-like apoptotic mechanism in which the BH3 domain is released upon caspase-mediated cleavage and a conformational change of the truncated form. Indeed, the BH3 peptide derived from Bfk exhibited ",2022

35031695,Synergistic activity of combined inhibition of anti-apoptotic molecules in B-cell precursor ALL.,"Targeting BCL-2, a key regulator of survival in B-cell malignancies including precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, has become a promising treatment strategy. However, given the redundancy of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins (BCL-2, BCL-XL, MCL-1), single targeting may not be sufficient. When analyzing the effects of BH3-mimetics selectively targeting BCL-XL and MCL-1 alone or in combination with the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax, heterogeneous sensitivity to either of these inhibitors was found in ALL cell lines and in patient-derived xenografts. Interestingly, some venetoclax-resistant leukemias were sensitive to the MCL-1-selective antagonist S63845 and/or BCL-XL-selective A-1331852 suggesting functional mutual substitution. Consequently, co-inhibition of BCL-2 and MCL-1 or BCL-XL resulted in synergistic apoptosis induction. Functional analysis by BH3-profiling and analysis of protein complexes revealed that venetoclax-treated ALL cells are dependent on MCL-1 and BCL-XL, indicating that MCL-1 or BCL-XL provide an Achilles heel in BCL-2-inhibited cells. The effect of combining BCL-2 and MCL-1 inhibition by venetoclax and S63845 was evaluated in vivo and strongly enhanced anti-leukemia activity was found in a pre-clinical patient-derived xenograft model. Our study offers in-depth molecular analysis of mutual substitution of BCL-2 family proteins in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and provides targets for combination treatment in vivo and in ongoing clinical studies.",2022

34953212,Artificial intelligence-based identification of octenidine as a Bcl-xL inhibitor.,"Apoptosis plays an essential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing cancer progression. Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic protein, is an important modulator of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and is a promising target for anticancer therapy. In this study, we identified octenidine as a novel Bcl-xL inhibitor through structural feature-based deep learning and molecular docking from a library of approved drugs. The NMR experiments demonstrated that octenidine binds to the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain-binding hydrophobic region that consists of the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains in Bcl-xL. A structural model of the Bcl-xL/octenidine complex revealed that octenidine binds to Bcl-xL in a similar manner to that of the well-known Bcl-2 family protein antagonist ABT-737. Using the NanoBiT protein-protein interaction system, we confirmed that the interaction between Bcl-xL and Bak-BH3 domains within cells was inhibited by octenidine. Furthermore, octenidine inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 breast and H1299 lung cancer cells by promoting apoptosis. Taken together, our results shed light on a novel mechanism in which octenidine directly targets anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL to trigger mitochondrial apoptosis in cancer cells.",2022
34907000,Senolytic-Mediated Elimination of Head and Neck Tumor Cells Induced Into Senescence by Cisplatin.,"Therapeutic outcomes achieved in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients by concurrent cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy initially reflect both tumor regression and tumor stasis. However, local and distant metastasis and disease relapse are common in HNSCC patients. In the current work, we demonstrate that cisplatin treatment induces senescence in both p53 wild-type HN30 and p53 mutant HN12 head and neck cancer models. We also show that tumor cells can escape from senescence both in vitro and in vivo. We further establish the effectiveness of the senolytic, ABT-263 (Navitoclax), in elimination of senescent tumor cells after cisplatin treatment. Navitoclax increased apoptosis by 3.3-fold (",2022
34861163,Silencing of p53 and CDKN1A establishes sustainable immortalized megakaryocyte progenitor cells from human iPSCs.,"Platelet transfusions are critical for severe thrombocytopenia but depend on blood donors. The shortage of donors and the potential of universal HLA-null platelet products have stimulated research on the ex vivo differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to platelets. We recently established expandable immortalized megakaryocyte cell lines (imMKCLs) from hPSCs by transducing MYC, BMI1, and BCL-XL (MBX). imMKCLs can act as cryopreservable master cells to supply platelet concentrates. However, the proliferation rates of the imMKCLs vary with the starting hPSC clone. In this study, we reveal from the gene expression profiles of several MKCL clones that the proliferation arrest is correlated with the expression levels of specific cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Silencing CDKN1A and p53 with the overexpression of MBX was effective at stably inducing imMKCLs that generate functional platelets irrespective of the hPSC clone. Collectively, this improvement in generating imMKCLs should contribute to platelet industrialization and platelet biology.",2021

Protective effects of thymoquinone (TQ), a phytochemical compound with antioxidant and anticancer influences, were investigated on sperm parameters, testicular structures, and sexual hormones in BL-treated mice. Forty-eight adult male Balb/c mice were randomly divided into six groups. Control group received normal saline; BL group received 10 mg/kg BL; TQ7.5 group received 7.5 mg/kg TQ; TQ15 group received 15 mg/kg TQ; BL+TQ7.5 group received 10 mg/kg BL and 7.5 mg/kg TQ; BL + TQ15 group received 10 mg/kg BL and 15 mg/kg TQ.

Here, we used a knock-in JAK2V617F mouse model and confirmed that Bcl-xL was overexpressed in erythroid progenitors. The myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)-induced phenotype in the peripheral blood by conditional knock-in of JAK2V617F was abrogated by conditional knockout of Bcl2l1, which presented anemia and thrombocytopenia independently of JAK2 mutation status.

34795418,Inhibitors of Bcl-2 and Bruton's tyrosine kinase synergize to abrogate diffuse large B-cell lymphoma growth in vitro and in orthotopic xenotransplantation models.,"Numerous targeted therapies have been developed for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, but the results of late-stage clinical trials were mostly disappointing and have led to very few new regulatory approvals. Here, we use single and combinatorial drug response profiling to show that the combined inhibition of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and of the tyrosine kinase BTK with the small molecules venetoclax and ibrutinib efficiently kills DLBCL cells in vitro. High Bcl-2 expression due to either BCL2 amplifications or translocations, in conjunction with chronic active BCR signaling accurately predict responses to dual Bcl-2/BTK inhibition. Orthotopic xenotransplantation and patient-derived xenograft models confirm that the combinatorial is superior to single-agent treatment in reducing the lymphoma burden. Combinatorial treatment further efficiently overcomes both primary and acquired resistance to venetoclax, which we could link to reduced expression of the Bcl-2 family members Bcl-X",2022

34770842,Computational Evaluation of Abrogation of HBx-Bcl-xL Complex with High-Affinity Carbon Nanotubes (Fullerene) to Halt the Hepatitis B Virus Replication.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the world's most prevalent chronic viral infection. More than 350 million individuals are chronic carriers of the virus, with an estimated 2 billion infected persons. For instance, the role of HBx protein in attachment and infection is very obvious and consequently deemed as an important druggable target. Targeting the interface and discovering novel drugs greatly advanced the field of therapeutics development. Therefore, in the current study, HBx to Bcl-xL is abrogated on high-affinity carbon nanotubes using computational structural biology tools. Our analysis revealed that among the total 62 carbon fullerenes, only 13 compounds exhibited inhibitory activity against HBx, which was further confirmed through IFD-based rescoring. Structural dynamics investigation revealed stable binding, compactness, and hydrogen bonds reprogramming. Moreover, the binding free energy calculation results revealed that the top hits1-4 possess the total binding energy of -54.36 kcal/mol (hit1), -50.81 kcal/mol (hit2), -47.09 kcal/mol (hit3), and -45.59 kcal/mol for hit4.

34724282,"Eriocitrin, a dietary flavonoid suppressed cell proliferation, induced apoptosis through modulation of JAK2/STAT3 and JNK/p38 MAPKs signaling pathway in MCF-7 cells.","Eriocitrin, a lemons flavanone, exhibits several biological properties, antiproliferative, and proapoptotic effects. However, its molecular mechanical action is not entirely clarified. Oxidative stress causes abnormal stimulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling has been strongly connected with the ruling of cell survival and apoptosis of cancer cells. Herein, we investigated an antiproliferative and proapoptotic effect that Eriocitrin modulates STAT3/MAPKs signaling activation in MCF-7 cells. We noticed that Eriocitrin strongly enhances reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, alteration of mitochondrial outer membrane potential, and enhances apoptotic morphological changes. Furthermore, Eriocitrin suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation via inhibiting an upstream molecule of JAK2 and Src kinase activation, thereby blocking STAT3 nuclear translocation. Similarly, Eriocitrin causes oxidative stress-mediated JNK/p38 MAPK signaling activation. We confirmed that Eriocitrin induced ROS-mediated apoptosis inhibited by the antioxidant substance of N-acetylcysteine. Eriocitrin induced apoptosis via suppression of STAT3 signaling regulated proteins, activating proapoptotic factors Bax, caspase 7, 8, 9 and suppressing Bcl-2, Bcl-x expression in MCF-7 cells. Overall, these results evidenced that Eriocitrin can affect multiple signaling events associated with tumorigenesis. From this evidence, Eriocitrin, a novel chemotherapeutic agent, can be used to treat breast cancer.",2022

Fission is largely dependent on recruitment of Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) to the receptor Mitochondrial fission factor (Mff) located on the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). Drp1 is a target for SUMOylation and its deSUMOylation, mediated by the SUMO protease SENP3, enhances the Drp1-Mff interaction to promote cell death in an oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) model of ischemia. Another interacting partner for Drp1 is the Bcl-2 family member Bcl-x ",2021
34707089,Venetoclax imparts distinct cell death sensitivity and adaptivity patterns in T cells.,"BH3 mimetics are increasingly used as anti-cancer therapeutics either alone or in conjunction with other chemotherapies. However, mounting evidence has also demonstrated that BH3 mimetics modulate varied amounts of apoptotic signaling in healthy immune populations. In order to maximize their clinical potential, it will be essential to understand how BH3 mimetics affect discrete immune populations and to determine how BH3 mimetic pressure causes immune system adaptation. Here we focus on the BCL-2 specific inhibitor venetoclax (ABT-199) and its effects following short-term and long-term BCL-2 blockade on T cell subsets. Seven day ""short-term"" ex vivo and in vivo BCL-2 inhibition led to divergent cell death sensitivity patterns in CD8",2021
34675185,Fatty acid synthase (FASN) regulates the mitochondrial priming of cancer cells.,"Inhibitors of the lipogenic enzyme fatty acid synthase (FASN) have attracted much attention in the last decade as potential targeted cancer therapies. However, little is known about the molecular determinants of cancer cell sensitivity to FASN inhibitors (FASNis), which is a major roadblock to their therapeutic application. Here, we find that pharmacological starvation of endogenously produced FAs is a previously unrecognized metabolic stress that heightens mitochondrial apoptotic priming and favors cell death induction by BH3 mimetic inhibitors. Evaluation of the death decision circuits controlled by the BCL-2 family of proteins revealed that FASN inhibition is accompanied by the upregulation of the pro-death BH3-only proteins BIM, PUMA, and NOXA. Cell death triggered by FASN inhibition, which causally involves a palmitate/NADPH-related redox imbalance, is markedly diminished by concurrent loss of BIM or PUMA, suggesting that FASN activity controls cancer cell survival by fine-tuning the BH3 only proteins-dependent mitochondrial threshold for apoptosis. FASN inhibition results in a heightened mitochondrial apoptosis priming, shifting cells toward a primed-for-death state ""addicted"" to the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2. Accordingly, co-administration of a FASNi synergistically augments the apoptosis-inducing activity of the dual BCL-X",2021

34564697,Combination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the MCL1 inhibitor S63845 exerts synergistic antitumorigenic effects on CML cells.,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment has dramatically improved the survival of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients, but measurable residual disease typically persists. To more effectively eradicate leukemia cells, simultaneous targeting of BCR-ABL1 and additional CML-related survival proteins has been proposed. Notably, several highly specific myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) inhibitors have recently entered clinical trials for various hematologic malignancies, although not for CML, reflecting the insensitivity of CML cell lines to single MCL1 inhibition. Here, we show that combining TKI (imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, or asciminib) treatment with the small-molecule MCL1 inhibitor S63845 exerted strong synergistic antiviability and proapoptotic effects on CML lines and CD34+ stem/progenitor cells isolated from untreated CML patients in chronic phase. Using wild-type BCR-ABL1-harboring CML lines and their T315I-mutated sublines (generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination), we prove that the synergistic proapoptotic effect of the drug combination depended on TKI-mediated BCR-ABL1 inhibition, but not on TKI-related off-target mechanisms. Moreover, we demonstrate that colony formation of CML but not normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells became markedly reduced upon combination treatment compared to imatinib monotherapy. Our results suggest that dual targeting of MCL1 and BCR-ABL1 activity may efficiently eradicate residual CML cells without affecting normal hematopoietic stem/progenitors.",2021
34534615,Inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling increased apoptosis and prevented the emergence of ALK-TKI-tolerant cells in ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer.,"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK-TKIs) have improved clinical outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring ALK- rearrangements. However, a small population of tumor cells survives due to adaptive resistance under drug pressure and ultimately acquires drug resistance. Thus, it is necessary to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the prevention of drug resistance to improve the prognosis of patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC. We identified novel adaptive resistance, generated through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun signaling, to initial ALK-TKIs-alectinib and brigatinib-in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Inhibition of JNK/c-Jun axis showed suppression of growth and promotion of apoptosis induced by ALK-TKIs in drug-tolerant cells. JNK inhibition, in combination with the use of ALK-TKIs, increased cell apoptosis through repression of the Bcl-xL proteins, compared with ALK-TKI monotherapy. Importantly, combination therapy targeting JNK and ALK significantly delayed the regrowth following cessation of these treatments. Together, our results demonstrated that JNK pathway activation plays a pivotal role in the intrinsic resistance to ALK-TKIs and the emergence of ALK-TKI-tolerant cells in ALK-rearranged NSCLC, thus indicating that optimal inhibition of tolerant signals combined with ALK-TKIs may potentially improve the outcome of ALK-rearranged NSCLC.",2021

34528298,"Curcumin, a potential initiator of apoptosis via direct interactions with Bcl-xL and Bid.","Apoptosis is a naturally occurring process during the growth and development of multicellular organisms and is increasingly active during times of cellular stress such as in response to intracellular DNA damage when removal of the host cell is paramount to prevent cancer. Unfortunately, once formed, cancer cells become impervious to apoptosis, creating a desperate need to identify an approach to induce apoptosis in these cells. An attractive option is to focus efforts on developing and locating compounds which activate apoptosis using natural compounds. Curcumin is a natural component in turmeric and is well-known for its pharmacological effects in preventing and combating many ailments and has been shown to decrease the rapid proliferation of a wide variety of tumor cells. However, to date, the apoptotic intermediates and interactions through which curcumin exerts its cytotoxic effects are unknown. Motivated by reports linking the intracellular modulation of the concentrations of Bid and Bcl-xL, following curcumin administration to cancer cells, we set out to probe for potential intermolecular interactions of these proteins with curcumin. Using several biophysical techniques, most notably, fluorescence, circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we reveal binding interactions of curcumin with both Bcl-xLΔC and full-length Bid (Bid-FL) and prove that this binding is hydrophobically driven and localized to well-known functional regions of each protein. Specifically, our NMR studies show that while Bid-FL interacts with curcumin through its hydrophobic and pore forming helices (α6-α7), Bcl-xLΔC interacts with curcumin via its BH3 binding pocket (α2-α3-α4-α5), a critical region for mediating apoptosis.",2022
34523144,High-resolution analysis of the conformational transition of pro-apoptotic Bak at the lipid membrane.,"Permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane by pore-forming Bcl2 proteins is a crucial step for the induction of apoptosis. Despite a large set of data suggesting global conformational changes within pro-apoptotic Bak during pore formation, high-resolution structural details in a membrane environment remain sparse. Here, we used NMR and HDX-MS (Hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry) in lipid nanodiscs to gain important high-resolution structural insights into the conformational changes of Bak at the membrane that are dependent on a direct activation by BH3-only proteins. Furthermore, we determined the first high-resolution structure of the Bak transmembrane helix. Upon activation, α-helix 1 in the soluble domain of Bak dissociates from the protein and adopts an unfolded and dynamic potentially membrane-bound state. In line with this finding, comparative protein folding experiments with Bak and anti-apoptotic BclxL suggest that α-helix 1 in Bak is a metastable structural element contributing to its pro-apoptotic features. Consequently, mutagenesis experiments aimed at stabilizing α-helix 1 yielded Bak variants with delayed pore-forming activity. These insights will contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of Bak-mediated membrane permeabilization.",2021
34493661,Lipids modulate the BH3-independent membrane targeting and activation of BAX and Bcl-xL.,"Regulation of apoptosis is tightly linked with the targeting of numerous Bcl-2 proteins to the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM), where their activation or inhibition dictates cell death or survival. According to the traditional view of apoptotic regulation, BH3-effector proteins are indispensable for the cytosol-to-MOM targeting and activation of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 protein family. This view is challenged by recent studies showing that these processes can occur in cells lacking BH3 effectors by as yet to be determined mechanism(s). Here, we exploit a model membrane system that recapitulates key features of MOM to demonstrate that the proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein BAX and antiapoptotic Bcl-xL have an inherent ability to interact with membranes in the absence of BH3 effectors, but only in the presence of cellular concentrations of Mg",2021
34414459,Reactive oxygen species induced by uric acid promote NRK‑52E cell apoptosis through the NEK7‑NLRP3 signaling pathway.,"Increasing uric acid (UA) could induce renal tubular epithelial cell (NRK‑52E) injury. However, the specific mechanism by which UA induces renal tubular epithelial cell injury remains unknown. It was hypothesized that UA induces renal tubular epithelial cell injury through reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the Never in mitosis gene A (NIMA)‑related kinase 7 (NEK7)/NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) signaling pathway. TUNEL assay and flow cytometry were applied to measure apoptosis, and the results of the present study showed that UA treatment induced apoptosis of NRK‑52E cells in a concentration‑dependent manner. Western blotting was performed to determine the expression levels of cleaved caspase‑3, Bax and Bcl‑xl, it was found that levels were significantly increased after UA treatment in NRK‑52E cells. ROS and apoptosis were predominantly induced in NRK‑52E cells and there was an association between ROS and apoptosis. Enhanced expression of NEK7, NLRP3, apoptosis‑associated speck‑like and caspase‑1 were observed in NRK‑52E cells treated with UA. The ROS inhibitor, N‑acetyl‑l‑cysteine, exerted a protective effect on the UA‑induced apoptosis of tubular epithelial cells by reducing excess ROS production, which significantly inhibited NEK7 and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These results indicated that UA activates ROS and induces apoptosis of NRK‑52E cells. The mechanism might be related to the regulation of the NEK7/NLRP3 signaling pathway.",2021
34412690,Mutual regulation between chicken telomerase reverse transcriptase and the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway inhibits apoptosis and promotes the replication of ALV-J in LMH cells.,"This study aimed to explore the mutual regulation between chicken telomerase reverse transcriptase (chTERT) and the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway and its effects on cell growth and avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) replication in LMH cells. First, LMH cells stably overexpressing the chTERT gene (LMH-chTERT cells) and corresponding control cells (LMH-NC cells) were successfully constructed with a lentiviral vector expression system. The results showed that chTERT upregulated the expression of β-catenin, Cyclin D1, TCF4 and c-Myc. chTERT expression level and telomerase activity were increased when cells were treated with LiCl. When the cells were treated with ICG001 or IWP-2, the activity of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway was significantly inhibited, and chTERT expression and telomerase activity were also inhibited. However, when the β-catenin gene was knocked down by small interfering RNA (siRNA), the changes in chTERT expression and telomerase activity were consistent with those in cells treated with ICG001 or IWP-2. These results indicated that chTERT and the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway can be mutually regulated. Subsequently, we found that chTERT not only shortened the cell cycle to promote proliferation but also inhibited apoptosis by downregulating the expression of Caspase 3, Caspase 9 and BAX; upregulating BCL-2 and BCL-X expression; and promoting autophagy. Moreover, chTERT significantly enhanced the migration ability of LMH cells, upregulated the protein and mRNA expression of ALV-J and increased the virus titre. ALV-J replication promoted chTERT expression and telomerase activity.",2021
34381022,Importance of Bcl-2-family proteins in murine hematopoietic progenitor and early B cells.,"Mitochondrial apoptosis regulates survival and development of hematopoietic cells. Prominent roles of some Bcl-2-family members in this regulation have been established, for instance for pro-apoptotic Bim and anti-apoptotic Mcl-1. Additional, mostly smaller roles are known for other Bcl-2-members but it has been extremely difficult to obtain a comprehensive picture of the regulation of mitochondrial apoptosis in hematopoietic cells by Bcl-2-family proteins. We here use a system of mouse 'conditionally immortalized' lymphoid-primed hematopoietic progenitor (LMPP) cells that can be differentiated in vitro to pro-B cells, to analyze the importance of these proteins in cell survival. We established cells deficient in Bim, Noxa, Bim/Noxa, Bim/Puma, Bim/Bmf, Bax, Bak or Bax/Bak and use specific inhibitors of Bcl-2, Bcl-X",2021
34359829,ER+ Breast Cancer Strongly Depends on MCL-1 and BCL-xL Anti-Apoptotic Proteins.,"Breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer and the major cause of mortality in women. The rapid development of various therapeutic options has led to the improvement of treatment outcomes; nevertheless, one-third of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive patients relapse due to cancer cell acquired resistance. Here, we use dynamic BH3 profiling (DBP), a functional predictive assay that measures net changes in apoptotic priming, to find new effective treatments for ER+ breast cancer. We observed anti-apoptotic adaptations upon treatment that pointed to metronomic therapeutic combinations to enhance cytotoxicity and avoid resistance. Indeed, we found that the anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-xL and MCL-1 are crucial for ER+ breast cancer cells resistance to therapy, as they exert a dual inhibition of the pro-apoptotic protein BIM and compensate for each other. In addition, we identified the AKT inhibitor ipatasertib and two BH3 mimetics targeting these anti-apoptotic proteins, S63845 and A-1331852, as new potential therapies for this type of cancer. Therefore, we postulate the sequential inhibition of both proteins using BH3 mimetics as a new treatment option for refractory and relapsed ER+ breast cancer tumors.",2021

Unfortunately, there are few effective therapeutic regimens. Therefore, we require novel treatment strategies with enhanced efficacy. The present study aimed to investigate the antitumor efficacy of APG-1252-M1, a dual inhibitor of BCL-2/BCL-XL, as a single agent and combined with gemcitabine. We applied various apoptotic assays and used subcutaneous transplanted NPC model to assess the in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity. Moreover, phospho-tyrosine kinase array was used to investigate the combined therapy's potential synergistic mechanism. In addition, further validation was performed using immunohistochemistry and western blotting. In vitro, we observed that APG-1252-M1 had moderate antitumor activity toward NPC cells; however, it markedly improved gemcitabine's ability to promote NPC cell apoptosis and suppress invasion, migration, and proliferation. Specifically, APG-1252 plus gemcitabine exhibited even remarkable antitumor activity in vivo. Mechanistically, the drug combination synergistically suppressed NPC by activating caspase-dependent pathways, blocking the phospho (p)-JAK-2/STAT3/MCL-1 signaling pathway, and inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In conclusion, the results indicated that the combination of APG-1252 and gemcitabine has synergistic anticancer activities against NPC, providing a promising treatment modality for patients with NPC.",2021

A significant number of patients experience drug resistance and development of relapsed tumors. Drugs that have the potential to re-sensitize relapsed tumor cells toward chemotherapy treatment are therefore of great clinical interest. Here, we used a drug profiling platform with PDX-derived primary rhabdomyosarcoma cells to screen a large drug library for compounds re-sensitizing relapse tumor cells toward standard chemotherapeutics used in rhabdomyosarcoma therapy. We identified ABT-263 (navitoclax) as most potent compound enhancing general chemosensitivity and used different pharmacologic and genetic approaches in vitro and in vivo to detect the NOXA-BCL-XL/MCL-1 balance to be involved in modulating drug response. Our data therefore suggests that players of the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic cascade are major targets for stimulation of response toward first-line therapies in rhabdomyosarcoma.",2021

34209035,RAB38 Facilitates Energy Metabolism and Counteracts Cell Death in Glioblastoma Cells.,"Glioblastoma is a high-grade glial neoplasm with a patient survival of 12-18 months. Therefore, the identification of novel therapeutic targets is an urgent need. RAB38 is a GTPase protein implicated in regulating cell proliferation and survival in tumors. The role of RAB38 in glioblastoma is relatively unexplored. Here, we test the hypothesis that RAB38 regulates glioblastoma growth using human glioblastoma cell lines. We found that genetic interference of RAB38 resulted in a decrease in glioblastoma growth through inhibition of proliferation and cell death induction. Transcriptome analysis showed that RAB38 silencing leads to changes in genes related to mitochondrial metabolism and intrinsic apoptosis (e.g., Bcl-xL). Consistently, rescue experiments demonstrated that loss of RAB38 causes a reduction in glioblastoma viability through downregulation of Bcl-xL. Moreover, RAB38 knockdown inhibited both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Interference with RAB38 enhanced cell death induced by BH3-mimetics. RAB38 antagonists are under development, but not yet clinically available. We found that FDA-approved statins caused a rapid reduction in RAB38 protein levels, increased cell death, and phenocopied some of the molecular changes elicited by loss of RAB38. In summary, our findings suggest that RAB38 is a potential therapeutic target for glioblastoma treatment.",2021
34192540,Revealing molecular pathways for cancer cell fitness through a genetic screen of the cancer translatome.,"The major cap-binding protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), an ancient protein required for translation of all eukaryotic genomes, is a surprising yet potent oncogenic driver. The genetic interactions that maintain the oncogenic activity of this key translation factor remain unknown. In this study, we carry out a genome-wide CRISPRi screen wherein we identify more than 600 genetic interactions that sustain eIF4E oncogenic activity. Our data show that eIF4E controls the translation of Tfeb, a key executer of the autophagy response. This autophagy survival response is triggered by mitochondrial proteotoxic stress, which allows cancer cell survival. Our screen also reveals a functional interaction between eIF4E and a single anti-apoptotic factor, Bcl-xL, in tumor growth. Furthermore, we show that eIF4E and the exon-junction complex (EJC), which is involved in many steps of RNA metabolism, interact to control the migratory properties of cancer cells. Overall, we uncover several cancer-specific vulnerabilities that provide further resolution of the cancer translatome.",2021
34182005,The interplay between apoptosis and cellular senescence: Bcl-2 family proteins as targets for cancer therapy.,"Cell death by apoptosis and permanent cell cycle arrest by senescence serve as barriers to the development of cancer. Chemotherapeutic agents not only induce apoptosis, they can also induce senescence known as therapy-induced senescence (TIS). There are, however, controversies whether TIS improves or worsens therapeutic outcome. Unlike apoptosis, which permanently removes cancer cells, senescent cells are metabolically active, and can contribute to tumor progression and relapse. If senescent cells are not cleared by the immune system or if cancer cells escape senescence, they may acquire resistance to apoptotic stimuli and become highly aggressive. Thus, there have been significant efforts in developing senolytics, drugs that target these pro-survival molecules to eliminate senescent cells. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins not only protect against cell death by apoptosis, but they also allow senescent cells to survive. While combining senolytics with chemotherapeutic drugs is an attractive approach, there are also limitations. Moreover, members of the Bcl-2 family have distinct effects on apoptosis and senescence. The purpose of this review article is to discuss recent literatures on how members of the Bcl-2 family orchestrate the interplay between apoptosis and senescence, and the challenges and progress in targeting these Bcl-2 family proteins for cancer therapy.",2022

Dysregulation of Bcl-x apoptotic isoforms caused by precarious equilibrium splicing is implicated in genesis and development of multiple human diseases, especially cancers. Exploring the mechanism of Bcl-x splicing and regulation has provided insight into the development of drugs that could contribute to sensitivity of cancer cells to death. On this basis, we review the multiple splicing patterns and structural characteristics of Bcl-x. Additionally, we outline the cis-regulatory elements, trans-acting factors as well as epigenetic modifications involved in the splicing regulation of Bcl-x. Furthermore, this review highlights aberrant splicing of Bcl-x involved in apoptosis evade, autophagy, metastasis, and therapy resistance of various cancer cells. Last, emphasis is given to the clinical role of targeting Bcl-x splicing correction in human cancer based on the splice-switching oligonucleotides, small molecular modulators and BH3 mimetics. Thus, it is highlighting significance of aberrant splicing isoforms of Bcl-x as targets for cancer therapy.",2021

However, long-term use of venetoclax may lead to secondary drug resistance, which constitutes an important obstacle to prolonging the duration of the therapeutic response. Here, we show that the acquired resistance to venetoclax in human AML cell lines depends on NF-κB activation rather than on the upregulation of anti-apoptotic BCL2L1 expression. Moreover, alkaliptosis induced by the small molecular compound JTC801, but not necroptosis and ferroptosis, inhibits the growth of venetoclax-resistant AML cells in vitro and in xenograft mouse models. Mechanistically, NF-κB-mediated CA9 downregulation is required for intracellular pH upregulation, thereby inducing alkaliptosis in venetoclax-resistant cells. These findings provide a new strategy to selectively remove venetoclax-resistant AML cells.",2021

THIM alters the expression level of factors involved in apoptosis. On the other hand, the anti-apoptotic effects of exercise have been reported. In this study, we aimed to discover the effect of three protocols of treadmill exercise on the expression level of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), BCL-2-associated death (BAD), BCL-2-associated X (BAX), BCL-XL, and BCL-2 (a pro-survival BCL-2 protein) in the hippocampus of control and THIM-exposed rats. Male Wistar rats were used in this research. Real-time PCR was applied to assess genes expression. The results showed that THIM increased the expression of pro-apoptotic factors (BAD and BAX), decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic factors (BCL-2 and BCL-XL), and decreased the expression of factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (TFAM and PGC-1α). Treadmill exercise protocols reversed the effect of THIM on all genes. In addition, treadmill exercise protocols decreased the expression of BAD and BAX, increased the expression of BCL-2, and increased the expression of TFAM and PGC-1α in control rats. In conclusion, THIM induced a pro-apoptotic effect and disturbed mitochondrial biogenesis and stability, whereas treadmill exercise reversed these effects.",2021

KRas is frequently mutated in pancreatic cancers. The growth of certain pancreatic cancers is KRas-dependent and can be suppressed by GSK-3 inhibitors, documenting a link between KRas and GSK-3. To further elucidate the roles of GSK-3β in drug-resistance, we transfected KRas-dependent MIA-PaCa-2 pancreatic cells with wild-type (WT) and kinase-dead (KD) forms of GSK-3β. Transfection of MIA-PaCa-2 cells with WT-GSK-3β increased their resistance to various chemotherapeutic drugs and certain small molecule inhibitors. Transfection of cells with KD-GSK-3β often increased therapeutic sensitivity. An exception was observed with cells transfected with WT-GSK-3β and sensitivity to the BCL2/BCLXL ABT737 inhibitor. WT-GSK-3β reduced glycolytic capacity of the cells but did not affect the basal glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration.

33863900,Structural insight into the molecular mechanism of p53-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis.,"The tumor suppressor p53 is mutated in approximately half of all human cancers. p53 can induce apoptosis through mitochondrial membrane permeabilization by interacting with and antagonizing the anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-xL and BCL-2. However, the mechanisms by which p53 induces mitochondrial apoptosis remain elusive. Here, we report a 2.5 Å crystal structure of human p53/BCL-xL complex. In this structure, two p53 molecules interact as a homodimer, and bind one BCL-xL molecule to form a ternary complex with a 2:1 stoichiometry. Mutations at the p53 dimer interface or p53/BCL-xL interface disrupt p53/BCL-xL interaction and p53-mediated apoptosis. Overall, our current findings of the bona fide structure of p53/BCL-xL complex reveal the molecular basis of the interaction between p53 and BCL-xL, and provide insight into p53-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis.",2021

33823136,An anterograde pathway for sensory axon degeneration gated by a cytoplasmic action of the transcriptional regulator P53.,"Axon remodeling through sprouting and pruning contributes to the refinement of developing neural circuits. A prominent example is the pruning of developing sensory axons deprived of neurotrophic support, which is mediated by a caspase-dependent (apoptotic) degeneration process. Distal sensory axons possess a latent apoptotic pathway, but a cell body-derived signal that travels anterogradely down the axon is required for pathway activation. The signaling mechanisms that underlie this anterograde process are poorly understood. Here, we show that the tumor suppressor P53 is required for anterograde signaling. Interestingly loss of P53 blocks axonal but not somatic (i.e., cell body) caspase activation. Unexpectedly, P53 does not appear to have an acute transcriptional role in this process and instead appears to act in the cytoplasm to directly activate the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in axons. Our data support the operation of a cytoplasmic role for P53 in the anterograde death of developing sensory axons.",2021

Interleukin 6, produced by mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), has been shown to modify the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins and their interaction with the pro-apoptotic BIM protein in MM cells. In this study, we assess the efficacy of S63845 and venetoclax in MM cells in direct co-culture with MSCs derived from MM patients (pMSCs) to identify additional mechanisms involved in the stroma-induced resistance to these agents. MicroRNAs miR-193b-3p and miR-21-5p emerged among the top deregulated miRNAs in myeloma cells when directly co-cultured with pMSCs, and we show their contribution to changes in MCL-1 and BCL-2 protein expression and in the activity of S63845 and venetoclax. Additionally, direct contact with pMSCs under S63845 and/or venetoclax treatment modifies myeloma cell dependence on different BCL-2 family anti-apoptotic proteins in relation to BIM, making myeloma cells more dependent on the non-targeted anti-apoptotic protein or BCL-X",2021

Several natural and synthetic pyrazole derivatives possess anti-cancer potential and some of them have underwent clinical trials. In this aspect, an investigation into the efficiency of the pyrazole nucleus to inhibit the growth and progression of various cancer cell lines/ experimental tumours would help in giving a better clarity to the anti-cancer behaviour of pyrazole containing drugs. This paper investigates the efficiency of pyrazole against Dalton's Lymphoma Ascites (DLA) cell line. Pyrazole inhibited the growth of DLA cells in vitro by committing them towards apoptosis. In vitro results were consistent in DLA induced murine solid tumour in vivo systems. Drug-treatment improved survival, reduced tumour loads, stabilized body weights and improved the haematological and serum biochemical parameters of DLA solid tumour bearing mice, thereby improving their overall survivability. Drug administration contained the aggravation of solid tumour by targeted downregulation of Cyclin-D1 and Ki-67. In addition, the mRNA expression levels of anti-apoptotic genes, BCL-2 and BCL-XL were downregulated in solid tumours, corroborating the in vitro results that pyrazole encourage apoptotic cell death in DLA cells. The new findings establish pyrazole as a potential anti-cancer drug candidate. The results must encourage future investigations into the efficacy of the drug against various cancer types.",2021
33669408,The Role of Bcl-xL Protein in Viral Infections.,"Bcl-xL represents a family of proteins responsible for the regulation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Due to its anti-apoptotic activity, Bcl-xL co-determines the viability of various virally infected cells. Their survival may determine the effectiveness of viral replication and spread, dynamics of systemic infection, and viral pathogenesis. In this paper, we have reviewed the role of Bcl-xL in the context of host infection by eight different RNA and DNA viruses: hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza A virus (IAV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1), Maraba virus (MRBV), Schmallenberg virus (SBV) and coronavirus (CoV). We have described an influence of viral infection on the intracellular level of Bcl-xL and discussed the impact of Bcl-xL-dependent cell survival control on infection-accompanying pathogenic events such as tissue damage or oncogenesis. We have also presented anti-viral treatment strategies based on the pharmacological regulation of Bcl-xL expression or activity.",2021
33664238,SRSF1 inhibits autophagy through regulating Bcl-x splicing and interacting with PIK3C3 in lung cancer.,"Alternative splicing is a critical process to generate protein diversity. However, whether and how alternative splicing regulates autophagy remains largely elusive. Here we systematically identify the splicing factor SRSF1 as an autophagy suppressor. Specifically, SRSF1 inhibits autophagosome formation by reducing the accumulation of LC3-II and numbers of autophagosomes in different cell lines. Mechanistically, SRSF1 promotes the splicing of the long isoform of Bcl-x that interacts with Beclin1, thereby dissociating the Beclin1-PIK3C3 complex. In addition, SRSF1 also directly interacts with PIK3C3 to disrupt the interaction between Beclin1 and PIK3C3. Consequently, the decrease of SRSF1 stabilizes the Beclin1 and PIK3C3 complex and activates autophagy. Interestingly, SRSF1 can be degraded by starvation- and oxidative stresses-induced autophagy through interacting with LC3-II, whereas reduced SRSF1 further promotes autophagy. This positive feedback is critical to inhibiting Gefitinib-resistant cancer cell progression both in vitro and in vivo. Consistently, the expression level of SRSF1 is inversely correlated to LC3 level in clinical cancer samples. Our study not only provides mechanistic insights of alternative splicing in autophagy regulation but also discovers a new regulatory role of SRSF1 in tumorigenesis, thereby offering a novel avenue for potential cancer therapeutics.",2021
33658550,Cryptic-site binding mechanism of medium-sized Bcl-xL inhibiting compounds elucidated by McMD-based dynamic docking simulations.,"We have performed multicanonical molecular dynamics (McMD) based dynamic docking simulations to study and compare the binding mechanism between two medium-sized inhibitors (ABT-737 and WEHI-539) that bind to the cryptic site of Bcl-xL, by exhaustively sampling the conformational and configurational space. Cryptic sites are binding pockets that are transiently formed in the apo state or are induced upon ligand binding. Bcl-xL, a pro-survival protein involved in cancer progression, is known to have a cryptic site, whereby the shape of the pocket depends on which ligand is bound to it. Starting from the apo-structure, we have performed two independent McMD-based dynamic docking simulations for each ligand, and were able to obtain near-native complex structures in both cases. In addition, we have also studied their interactions along their respective binding pathways by using path sampling simulations, which showed that the ligands form stable binding configurations via predominantly hydrophobic interactions. Although the protein started from the apo state, both ligands modulated the pocket in different ways, shifting the conformational preference of the sub-pockets of Bcl-xL. We demonstrate that McMD-based dynamic docking is a powerful tool that can be effectively used to study binding mechanisms involving a cryptic site, where ligand binding requires a large conformational change in the protein to occur.",2021

We benchmark the performance of base editors in positive and negative selection screens, identifying known loss-of-function mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 with high precision. To demonstrate the utility of base editor screens to probe small molecule-protein interactions, we screen against BH3 mimetics and PARP inhibitors, identifying point mutations that confer drug sensitivity or resistance. We also create a library of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) predicted to generate 52,034 ClinVar variants in 3,584 genes and conduct screens in the presence of cellular stressors, identifying loss-of-function variants in numerous DNA damage repair genes. We anticipate that this screening approach will be broadly useful to readily and scalably functionalize genetic variants.",2021

Recently, small molecules targeting the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins have been identified, and with venetoclax the first of these BH3 mimetics has been approved for the treatment of leukemia. In solid tumors the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL are frequently overexpressed or genetically amplified.

33585438,Sesquiterpene Alcohol Cedrol Chemosensitizes Human Cancer Cells and Suppresses Cell Proliferation by Destabilizing Plasma Membrane Lipid Rafts.,"Chemosensitization of cancer cells with small molecules may improve the therapeutic index of antitumoral agents by making tumor cells sensitive to the drug regimen and thus overcome the treatment resistance and side effects of single therapy. Cell membrane lipid rafts are known to transduce various signaling events in cell proliferation. Sensitizing cancer cells may cause modulation of membrane lipid rafts which may potentially be used in improving anticancer drug response. Cedrol, a natural sesquiterpene alcohol, was used to treat human leukemia K562 and colon cancer HT-29 cell lines, and effects were observed. Cedrol decreased the cell viability by inducing apoptosis in both cell lines by activation of pro-apoptosis protein BID and inhibition of anti-apoptosis proteins Bcl-X ",2020

Yet little is known about the molecular signatures discriminating physiological blood vessels from their diseased counterparts, leading to off-target effects of therapy. We demonstrate that in contrast to healthy blood vessels, pathological vessels engage pathways of cellular senescence. Senescent (p16",2021
33546395,Bcl-xL as a Modulator of Senescence and Aging.,"Many features of aging result from the incapacity of cells to adapt to stress conditions. When cells are overwhelmed by stress, they can undergo senescence to avoid unrestricted growth of damaged cells. Recent findings have proven that cellular senescence is more than that. A specific grade of senescence promotes embryo development, tissue remodeling and wound healing. However, constant stresses and a weakening immune system can lead to senescence chronicity with aging. The accumulation of senescent cells is directly related to tissue dysfunction and age-related pathologies. Centenarians, the most aged individuals, should accumulate senescent cells and suffer from their deleterious effects, however, they enjoy a compression of morbidity. We have shown that they overexpress B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL). Bcl-xL could avoid an excessive burden of senescent cells through the regulation of intrinsic apoptosis, mitochondrial bioenergetics and oxidative stress. On the other hand, Bcl-xL maintains a fully functional immune system that ensures an efficient clearance of senescent cells. Moreover, there is a paradox, as inhibitors of Bcl-xL have been employed as senolytic agents, which have been shown to protect from aging in animal models. In this review, we aim to discuss how Bcl-xL could modulate senescence-associated harmful effects in centenarians, protecting them from the burden of accumulation of senescent cells.",2021
33495554,Regulation of Bcl-XL by non-canonical NF-κB in the context of CD40-induced drug resistance in CLL.,"In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the lymph node (LN) microenvironment delivers critical survival signals by inducing the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 members Bcl-XL, Bfl-1, and Mcl-1, resulting in apoptosis blockade. We determined previously that resistance against various drugs, among which is the clinically applied BH3 mimetic venetoclax, is dominated by upregulation of the anti-apoptotic regulator Bcl-XL. Direct clinical targeting of Bcl-XL by, e.g., Navitoclax is however not desirable due to induction of thrombocytopenia. Since the actual regulation of Bcl-XL in CLL in the context of the LN microenvironment is not well elucidated, we investigated various candidate LN signals to drive Bcl-XL expression. We found a dominance for NF-κB signaling upon CD40 stimulation, which results in activation of both the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathways. We demonstrate that expression of Bcl-XL is first induced by the canonical NF-κB pathway, and subsequently boosted and continued via non-canonical NF-κB signaling through stabilization of NIK. NF-κB subunits p65 and p52 can both bind to the Bcl-XL promoter and activate transcription upon CD40 stimulation. Moreover, canonical NF-κB signaling was correlated with Bfl-1 expression, whereas Mcl-1 in contrast, was not transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB. Finally, we applied a novel compound targeting NIK to selectively inhibit the non-canonical NF-κB pathway and showed that venetoclax-resistant CLL cells were sensitized to venetoclax. In conclusion, protective signals from the CLL microenvironment can be tipped towards apoptosis sensitivity by interfering with non-canonical NF-κB signaling.",2021
33485842,Gene commander in the trash heap: Transcriptional regulation and ubiquitination modification mediated by RNF6 in carcinogenesis.,"RING finger protein 6 (RNF6), a RING finger protein, has been identified as a potential tumor promoter in several cancers. However, the exact mechanism of RNF6 in cancer remains elusive. As in various diseases, RNF6 may be involved in regulating cell growth, cell proliferation, invasion, cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cell adhesion through E3 ligase-mediated ubiquitination. Thus, the research on RNF6 is mainly focused on the ubiquitination of RNF6 in recent years. This article summarizes the role of RNF6 ubiquitination in various physiological and pathological mechanisms, such as Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, Wnt/β-catenin pathway, RNF6/ERα/Bcl-xL axis, and provides knowledge and understanding for the treatment of diseases.",2021
33470891,Intrinsic and Extrinsic Cell Apoptotic Pathways in Patients with HTLV-1-Associated Myelopathy/Tropical Spastic Paraparesis: A Systematic Review.,"We aimed to verify the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic cell apoptotic pathways on the inhibition of cellular apoptosis in patients with tropical spastic paralysis/myelopathy related to human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1. The databases accessed were PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science. Neither the time of publishing nor the language of the articles was limited. The descriptors used for this systematic literature review were: Tropical Paraparesis, Proto-Oncogenic Protein C, Bcl-2, Bcl-X Protein, Bax protein, Fas ligand (FasL) protein, Fas receptor, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD)-like apoptosis regulating. The search resulted in 546 articles from which 9 articles were selected for analysis; ranging from serum levels of Bcl-2, Fas and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the levels of cellular expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL the TCD4+ lymphocytes accessed by western blot. Most studies accessed either gene expression or polymorphism of Fas, FasL, and TRAIL in patients with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), whereas one study used flow cytometry and fluorescence to determine Fas expression. Increased Bcl-xL expression inhibited T lymphocyte apoptosis, whereas Bcl-2, serum levels, and cellular expression did not influence T lymphocyte apoptosis and serum levels of Fas were significantly higher and associated with markers of leukocyte activation in patients with HAM/TSP. In addition, Fas polymorphism (FAS-670AA) was associated with higher proviral load. There is a need for additional research on this issue since the number of patients was small and the studies presented higher heterogeneity.",2021

We hypothesized that reducing platelet numbers by inducing their premature apoptotic death would decrease atherosclerosis. Approach and Results: This was achieved by targeting the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-x",2021
33382670,Piperine Inhibits Cell Proliferation and Induces Apoptosis of Human Gastric Cancer Cells by Downregulating Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PI3K)/Akt Pathway.,"BACKGROUND Piperine has been reported to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in various cancer cells. This study aimed to explore the efficacy and underlying mechanism of piperine in human gastric cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS MTT assay was performed to examine the effect of piperine (concentrations of 0-300 μM) on the proliferation of human gastric cancer SNU-16 cells and normal human gastric epithelial GES-1 cells. Flow cytometry and Western blot were used to determine cell apoptosis and the expression level of protein (Cyto C, cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, Bad, Bcl-xl, PI3K, pPI3K, Akt, and pAkt), respectively. To further investigate the anti-tumor mechanism of piperine in SNU-16 cells, we used a small-molecule Akt activator SC79 in this study. The in vivo mechanism of piperine against gastric cancer was evaluated using a xenograft tumor model. RESULTS The results showed that piperine inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of SNU-16 cells. Piperine upregulated the protein expression of Bax, Bad, Cyto C, cleaved PARP, and cleaved caspase-3, but downregulated the protein expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, pPI3k, and pAkt. However, SC79 reversed the function of piperine on the apoptosis-related proteins. An in vivo study revealed that, compared with the control group, the tumor volume of mice treated with piperine was significantly reduced. Piperine enhanced cleaved caspase-3 expression but decreased Ki-67 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the nontoxicity effect of piperine was confirmed by H&E staining analysis in kidney and heart tissues of mice. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that piperine inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of human gastric cancer cells through inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.",2020
33370709,Dihydroartemisinin inhibits the tumorigenesis and invasion of gastric cancer by regulating STAT1/KDR/MMP9 and P53/BCL2L1/CASP3/7 pathways.,"Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), an effective antimalarial drug, has been widely investigated as an anti-tumor agent. Although previous studies have indicated the potential therapeutic effects of DHA on multiple malignancies, its detailed molecular mechanisms in gastric cancer (GC) are still undocumented. In the present study, we applied network pharmacology and bioinformatics (gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses) to obtain the collective targets of DHA and GC and analyzed their involvement in constructing a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The top 10% hub targets in this network were identified, and TCGA database was utilized for the single gene analysis of their correlation with the prognosis of GC. CCK8, EdU, Transwell, and flow cytometry analyses were conducted, and subcutaneous xenograft tumor models were constructed to assess the effects of DHA on the tumorigenesis and invasion of GC. Furthermore, the targets of DHA were verified by molecular docking, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and western blot analyses in GC cells. The results indicated that the common targets of DHA and GC were enriched in multiple cancer-related pathways including KDR, STAT1 and apoptosis signaling pathways, where the core genes included KDR, MMP9, STAT1, TP53, CASP3/7 and BCL2L1. The lowered expression of KDR and increased expression of TP53 and CASP7 harbored a favorable survival for patients with GC patients. CASP7 showed a positive correlation with CASP3 but a negative correlation with KDR and could be regarded as an independent protective factor for overall survival in GC. Moreover, DHA treatment induced cell apoptosis and suppressed the cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, cycle progression and invasive capabilities both in vitro and in vivo. DHA also upregulated p53, CASP3, and cleaved-CASP3 and downregulated BCL2L1, MMP9, KDR, p-KDR, STAT1 and p-STAT1 in GC cell lines. In conclusion, DHA could suppress the tumorigenesis and invasion of GC by regulating STAT1/KDR/MMP9 and p53/BCL2L1/CASP3/7 pathways. Our findings might provide a novel approach for the treatment of GC.",2021
33356836,Pharmacological inactivation of CDK2 inhibits MYC/BCL-XL-driven leukemia in vivo through induction of cellular senescence.,"Deregulated expression of the MYC oncogene is a frequent event during tumorigenesis and generally correlates with aggressive disease and poor prognosis. While MYC is a potent inducer of apoptosis, it often suppresses cellular senescence, which together with apoptosis is an important barrier against tumor development. For this latter function, MYC is dependent on cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). Here, we utilized a MYC/BCL-X",2021
33340237,Pharmacological preconditioning protects from ischemia/reperfusion-induced apoptosis by modulating Bcl-xL expression through a ROS-dependent mechanism.,"Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a frequent perioperative threat, with numerous strategies developed to limit and/or prevent it. One interesting axis of research is the anesthetic preconditioning (APc) agent's hypothesis (such as sevoflurane, SEV). However, APc's mode of action is still poorly understood and volatile anesthetics used as preconditioning agents are often not well suited in clinical practice. Here, in vitro using H9C2 cells lines (in myeloblast state or differentiated toward cardiomyocytes) and in vivo in mice, we identified that SEV-induced APc is mediated by a mild induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that activates Akt and induces the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL), therefore protecting cardiomyocytes from I/R-induced death. Furthermore, we extended these results to human cardiomyocytes (derived from induced pluripotent stem - IPS - cells). Importantly, we demonstrated that this protective signaling pathway induced by SEV could be stimulated using the antidiabetic agent metformin (MET), suggesting the preconditioning properties of MET. Altogether, our study identified a signaling pathway allowing APc of cardiac injuries as well as a rational for the use of MET as a pharmacological preconditioning agent to prevent I/R injuries.",2021

33236795,BCL-XL exerts a protective role against anemia caused by radiation-induced kidney damage.,"Studies of gene-targeted mice identified the roles of the different pro-survival BCL-2 proteins during embryogenesis. However, little is known about the role(s) of these proteins in adults in response to cytotoxic stresses, such as treatment with anti-cancer agents. We investigated the role of BCL-XL in adult mice using a strategy where prior bone marrow transplantation allowed for loss of BCL-XL exclusively in non-hematopoietic tissues to prevent anemia caused by BCL-XL deficiency in erythroid cells. Unexpectedly, the combination of total body γ-irradiation (TBI) and genetic loss of Bcl-x caused secondary anemia resulting from chronic renal failure due to apoptosis of renal tubular epithelium with secondary obstructive nephropathy. These findings identify a critical protective role of BCL-XL in the adult kidney and inform on the use of BCL-XL inhibitors in combination with DNA damage-inducing drugs for cancer therapy. Encouragingly, the combination of DNA damage-inducing anti-cancer therapy plus a BCL-XL inhibitor could be tolerated in mice, at least when applied sequentially.",2020
33205588,Chemical Translational Biology: Redefining Druggability of Protein-Protein Interactions.,"Chemical biologists use chemical tools to answer biological questions. The translational application of these principles has led to an explosion in the discovery and druggability of new protein targets, including protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Proteins tend to interact with other macromolecules using relatively large and featureless binding surfaces, which has hampered traditional drug discovery efforts, particularly for interactions with weaker affinity. In this article, I discuss several emerging strategies for targeting PPIs, including computational and structural methods and novel screening approaches. In particular, I focus on hijacking intrinsic protein allosteric pathways for the discovery and design of small-molecule and peptide ligands.",2021

However, there are contrasting data regarding the useful and toxic effects of the anions. The primary scope of this study was to analyze the beneficial/detrimental alterations in redox status, mitochondrial dynamics and function, and cellular fitness in cardiomyoblasts inflicted by nitrite under hyperglycemic conditions compared with normoglycemia.

33155660,Pimozide augments bromocriptine lethality in prolactinoma cells and in a xenograft model via the STAT5/cyclin D1 and STAT5/Bcl‑xL signaling pathways.,"As hyperprolactinemia is observed in patients with bromocriptine‑resistant prolactinoma, prolactin (PRL) has been implicated in the development of bromocriptine resistance. Since PRL primarily mediates cell survival and drug resistance via the Janus kinase‑2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A (STAT5) signaling pathway, the STAT5 inhibitor, pimozide, may inhibit cell proliferation and reverse bromocriptine resistance in prolactinoma cells. In the present study, compared with bromocriptine or pimozide alone, the combination of pimozide and bromocriptine exerted enhanced reduction in cell growth and proliferation, and increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in bromocriptine‑resistant prolactinoma cells. A reduction in phospho‑STAT5, cyclin D1 and B‑cell lymphoma extra‑large (Bcl‑xL) expression levels were observed in cells treated with the combination of drugs. In addition, pimozide suppressed spheroid formation of human pituitary adenoma stem‑like cells, and reduced the protein expression of the cancer stem cell markers, CD133 and nestin. Pimozide did not exert any additional antitumor activity in STAT5‑knockdown primary culture cells of human bromocriptine‑resistant prolactinomas. Furthermore, Pimozide combined with bromocriptine treatment significantly reduced human prolactinoma xenograft growth. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses also demonstrated significant inhibition of cell proliferation and stem cell marker proteins in vivo. Collectively, these data indicated that pimozide treatment reduced prolactinoma growth by targeting both proliferating cells and stem cells, at least in part, by inhibiting the STAT5/Bcl‑xL and STAT5/cyclin D1 signaling pathways.",2021
33124021,Immune Thrombocytopenia Plasma-Derived Exosomes Impaired Megakaryocyte and Platelet Production through an Apoptosis Pathway.,"Reduced megakaryocyte (MK) apoptosis and insufficient platelet production play important roles in the pathogenesis of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). The contribution of plasma-derived exosomes to the decreased platelet count in ITP has not been entirely understood. Here, we found the percentage of apoptotic MKs in patients with ITP was significantly lower than those in healthy volunteers. In the presence of ITP plasma-derived exosomes (ITP-Exo), the apoptosis of MKs was reduced during the process of MK differentiation in vitro, which contributed to the reduced platelet production by Bcl-xL/caspase signaling. Furthermore, in vivo study demonstrated that ITP-Exo administration led to significantly delayed platelet recovery in mice after 3.5 Gy of irradiation. All these findings indicated that ITP-Exo, as a regulator of platelet production, impaired MK apoptosis and platelet production through Bcl-xL/caspase signaling, unveiling new mechanisms for reduced platelet count in ITP.",2021
33118312,Hydrogen sulphide ameliorates dopamine-induced astrocytic inflammation and neurodegeneration in minimal hepatic encephalopathy.,"It has been demonstrated that the action of dopamine (DA) could enhance the production of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) by astrocytes and potentiate neuronal apoptosis in minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE). Recently, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) has been found to have neuroprotective properties. Our study addressed whether NaHS could rescue DA-challenged inflammation and apoptosis in neurons to ameliorate memory impairment in MHE rats and in the neuron and astrocyte coculture system. We found that NaHS suppressed DA-induced p65 acetylation, resulting in reduced TNF-α production in astrocytes both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, decreased apoptosis was observed in neurons exposed to conditioned medium from DA + NaHS-challenged astrocytes, which was similar to the results obtained in the neurons exposed to TNF-α + NaHS, suggesting a therapeutic effect of NaHS on the suppression of neuronal apoptosis via the reduction of TNF-α level. DA triggered the inactivation of p70 S6 ribosomal kinase (S6K1) and dephosphorylation of Bad, resulting in the disaggregation of Bclxl and Bak and the release of cytochrome c (Cyt. c), and this process could be reversed by NaHS administration. Our work demonstrated that NaHS attenuated DA-induced astrocytic TNF-α release and ameliorated inflammation-induced neuronal apoptosis in MHE. Further research into this approach may uncover future potential therapeutic strategies for MHE.",2020
33116025,miR-374 improves cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury by targeting Wnt5a.,"To date, studies have demonstrated the potential functions of microRNAs in cerebral ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury. Herein, we established a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in rats and then subjected them to reperfusion to explore the role of microRNA-374 (miR-374) in cerebral IR injury. After reperfusion, the endogenous miR-374 level decreased, and the expression of its target gene, Wnt5a, increased in brain tissues. Intracerebral pretreatment of miR-374 agomir attenuated cerebral damage induced by IR, including neurobehavioral deficits, infarction, cerebral edema and blood-brain barrier disruption. Moreover, rats pretreated with miR-374 agomir showed a remarkable decrease in apoptotic neurons, which was further confirmed by reduced BAX expression as well as increased BCL-2 and BCL-XL expression. A dual-luciferase reporter assay substantiated that Wnt5a was the target gene of miR-374. miR-374 might protect against brain injury by downregulating Wnt5a in rats after IR. Thus, our study provided a novel mechanism of cerebral IR injury from the perspective of miRNA regulation.",2021
33105692,In Cellulo Evaluation of the Therapeutic Potential of NHC Platinum Compounds in Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma.,"We describe here the evaluation of the cytotoxic efficacy of two platinum (II) complexes bearing an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand, a pyridine ligand and bromide or iodide ligands on a panel of human metastatic cutaneous melanoma cell lines representing different genetic subsets including BRAF-inhibitor-resistant cell lines, namely A375, SK-MEL-28, MeWo, HMCB, A375-R, SK-MEL-5-R and 501MEL-R. Cisplatin and dacarbazine were also studied for comparison purposes. Remarkably, the iodine-labelled Pt-NHC complex strongly inhibited proliferation of all tested melanoma cells after 1-h exposure, likely due to its rapid uptake by melanoma cells. The mechanism of this inhibitory activity involves the formation of DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis. Considering the intrinsic chemoresistance of metastatic melanoma cells of current systemic treatments, these findings are promising and could give research opportunities in the future to improve the prognosis of patients suffering from unresectable metastatic melanoma that are not eligible or that do not respond to the most effective drugs available to date, namely BRAF inhibitors and the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb).",2020

33076337,Development of Conformational Antibodies to Detect Bcl-xL's Amyloid Aggregates in Metal-Induced Apoptotic Neuroblastoma Cells.,"Bcl-xL, a member of the Bcl-2 family, is a pro-survival protein involved in apoptosis regulation. We have previously reported the ability of Bcl-xL to form various types of fibers, from native to amyloid conformations. Here, we have mimicked the effect of apoptosis-induced caspase activity on Bcl-xL by limited proteolysis using trypsin. We show that cleaved Bcl-xL (ΔN-Bcl-xL) forms fibers that exhibit the features of amyloid structures (BclxLcf37). Moreover, three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), produced by mouse immunization and directed against ΔN-Bcl-xL or Bcl-xL fibers, were selected and characterized. Our results show that these mAbs specifically target ΔN-Bcl-xL in amyloid fibers in vitro. Upon metal-stress-induced apoptosis, these mAbs are able to detect the presence of Bcl-xL in amyloid aggregates in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell lines. In conclusion, these specific mAbs directed against amyloidogenic conformations of Bcl-xL constitute promising tools for studying, in vitro and in cellulo, the contribution of Bcl-xL in apoptosis. These mAbs may further help in developing new diagnostics and therapies, considering Bcl-xL as a strategic target for treating brain lesions relevant to stroke and neurodegenerative diseases.",2020

33066573,Regulation of Platelet Production and Life Span: Role of Bcl-xL and Potential Implications for Human Platelet Diseases.,"Blood platelets have important roles in haemostasis, where they quickly stop bleeding in response to vascular damage. They have also recognised functions in thrombosis, immunity, antimicrobal defense, cancer growth and metastasis, tumour angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, inflammatory diseases, wound healing, liver regeneration and neurodegeneration. Their brief life span in circulation is strictly controlled by intrinsic apoptosis, where the prosurvival Bcl-2 family protein, Bcl-xL, has a major role. Blood platelets are produced by large polyploid precursor cells, megakaryocytes, residing mainly in the bone marrow. Together with Mcl-1, Bcl-xL regulates megakaryocyte survival. This review describes megakaryocyte maturation and survival, platelet production, platelet life span and diseases of abnormal platelet number with a focus on the role of Bcl-xL during these processes.",2020
33050987,Relative strength of 5' splice-site strength defines functions of SRSF2 and SRSF6 in alternative splicing of Bcl-x pre-mRNA.,"Bcl-x, a member of the Bcl-2 family, plays a key role in apoptosis. Alternative splicing of Bcl-x pre-mRNA through alternative 5' splice-site selection produces an anti-apoptotic mRNA isoform that includes exon 2b and a pro-apoptotic Bcl-x mRNA isoform that excludes exon 2b. Here we used Bcl-x minigene and identified SRSF2 and SRSF6 as two regulatory factors of 5' splice-site selection of Bcl-x pre-mRNA. We selected binding clusters closer to 5' splice-sites from multiple potential binding sites of SRSF2 and SRSF6 to perform loss of functions analysis through site-directed mutagenesis. Our results demonstrated that these mutations did not abolish regulatory functions of SRSF2 or SRSF6, indicating that a single binding motif or a cluster was not a functional target of these proteins in Bcl-x pre-mRNA splicing. Random deletion mutagenesis did not disrupt the role of SRSF2 and SRSF6. Importantly, mutagenesis of 5' splice-site to a conserved or a weaker score demonstrated that the weaker strength of the target 5' splice-site or higher strength of the other 5' splice-site strength limited the role of SRSF2 and SRSF6 in 5' splice-site activation.

We evaluated the possible nephroprotective potential of short-term DR in young and old rats. DR in young rats resulted in pronounced beneficial effects normalizing lipid metabolism (triglycerides concentration, adiponectin level) activating autophagic-lysosomal system evaluated by LC3II/LC3I ratio, LAMP1, p62/SQSTM1 levels, and LysoTracker Green staining.

Yet, the structural details of the conformational changes of pro- and antiapoptotic proteins and their interactions remain unclear. Pulse dipolar spectroscopy (double electron-electron resonance [DEER], also known as PELDOR) in combination with spin-labeled apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins unveils conformational changes and interactions of each protein player via detection of intra- and inter-protein distances. Here, we present the synthesis and characterization of pro-apoptotic BimBH3 peptides of different lengths carrying cysteines for labeling with nitroxide or gadolinium spin probes. We show by DEER that the length of the peptides modulates their homo-interactions in the absence of other Bcl-2 proteins and solve by X-ray crystallography the structure of a BimBH3 tetramer, revealing the molecular details of the inter-peptide interactions. Finally, we prove that using orthogonal labels and three-channel DEER we can disentangle the Bim-Bim, Bcl-xL-Bcl-xL, and Bim-Bcl-xL interactions in a simplified interactome.",2021

BH3 mimetics targeting Bcl-2's hydrophobic cleft have been developed, including venetoclax as a promising anticancer precision medicine for treating CLL patients. Recently, BDA-366 was identified as a small molecule BH4-domain antagonist that could kill lung cancer and multiple myeloma cells. BDA-366 was proposed to switch Bcl-2 from an antiapoptotic into a proapoptotic protein, thereby activating Bax and inducing apoptosis. Here, we scrutinized the therapeutic potential and mechanism of action of BDA-366 in CLL and DLBCL. Although BDA-366 displayed selective toxicity against both cell types, the BDA-366-induced cell death did not correlate with Bcl-2-protein levels and also occurred in the absence of Bcl-2. Moreover, although BDA-366 provoked Bax activation, it did neither directly activate Bax nor switch Bcl-2 into a Bax-activating protein in in vitro Bax/liposome assays. Instead, in primary CLL cells and DLBCL cell lines, BDA-366 inhibited the activity of the PI3K/AKT pathway, resulted in Bcl-2 dephosphorylation and reduced Mcl-1-protein levels without affecting the levels of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. Hence, our work challenges the current view that BDA-366 is a BH4-domain antagonist of Bcl-2 that turns Bcl-2 into a pro-apoptotic protein. Rather, our results indicate that other mechanisms beyond switching Bcl-2 conformation underlie BDA-366's cell-death properties that may implicate Mcl-1 downregulation and/or Bcl-2 dephosphorylation.",2020
32888404,Conformational States of the Cytoprotective Protein Bcl-xL.,"Bcl-xL is a major inhibitor of apoptosis, a fundamental homeostatic process of programmed cell death that is highly conserved across evolution. Because it plays prominent roles in cancer, Bcl-xL is a major target for anticancer therapy and for studies aimed at understanding its structure and activity. Although Bcl-xL is active primarily at intracellular membranes, most studies have focused on soluble forms of the protein lacking both the membrane-anchoring C-terminal tail and the intrinsically disordered loop, and this has resulted in a fragmented view of the protein's biological activity. Here, we describe the conformation of full-length Bcl-xL. Using NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and isothermal titration calorimetry, we show how the three structural elements affect the protein's structure, dynamics, and ligand-binding activity in both its soluble and membrane-anchored states. The combined data provide information about the molecular basis for the protein's functionality and a view of its complex molecular mechanisms.",2020
32887697,Venetoclax Increases Intratumoral Effector T Cells and Antitumor Efficacy in Combination with Immune Checkpoint Blockade.,"The antiapoptotic protein BCL2 plays critical roles in regulating lymphocyte development and immune responses, and has also been implicated in tumorigenesis and tumor survival. However, it is unknown whether BCL2 is critical for antitumor immune responses. We evaluated whether venetoclax, a selective small-molecule inhibitor of BCL2, would influence the antitumor activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). We demonstrate in mouse syngeneic tumor models that venetoclax can augment the antitumor efficacy of ICIs accompanied by the increase of PD-1+ T effector memory cells. Venetoclax did not impair human T-cell function in response to antigen stimuli ",2021
32876914,Stenotrophomonas maltophilia outer membrane protein A induces epithelial cell apoptosis via mitochondrial pathways.,"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (S. maltophilia) is a common opportunistic pathogen in intensive care units and causes infections most often after surgeries in immune-compromised patients such as those undergoing chemotherapy. Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) is the most abundant of the outer membrane proteins in S. maltophilia. Previous studies on OmpA usually focus on its interaction with the host cells and its role in vaccine development. However, the impact of OmpA on the virulence of S. maltophilia to host cells and the effects on apoptosis remain unclear. In this study, we exposed purified recombinant S. maltophilia OmpA (rOmpA) to HEp-2 cells and investigated the effects of OmpA on epithelial cell apoptosis. Morphologic and flow cytometric analyses revealed that HEp-2 cells stimulated with rOmpA multiple apoptosis features, including nuclear roundness and pyknosis, chromatin aggregation, and phosphatidylserine eversion. We found that rOmpA regulated the protein levels of Bax and Bcl-xL in HEp-2 cells, leading to changes in mitochondria permeability and the release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factors into the cytoplasm. These subsequently activate the caspase-9/caspase-3 pathway that promote apoptosis. We also observed that rOmpA enhanced the generation of reactive oxygen species and increased intracellular Ca",2020
32839432,The BCL-2 selective inhibitor ABT-199 sensitizes soft tissue sarcomas to proteasome inhibition by a concerted mechanism requiring BAX and NOXA.,"Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies predominantly affecting children and young adults. Despite improvements in multimodal therapies, 5-year survival rates are only 50% and new treatment options in STS are urgently needed. To develop a rational combination therapy for the treatment of STS we focused on ABT-199 (Venetoclax), a BCL-2 specific BH3-mimetic, in combination with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BZB). Simultaneous inhibition of BCL-2 and the proteasome resulted in strongly synergistic apoptosis induction. Mechanistically, ABT-199 mainly affected the multidomain effector BAX by liberating it from BCL-2 inhibition. The combination with BZB additionally resulted in the accumulation of BOK, a BAX/BAK homologue, and of the BH3-only protein NOXA, which inhibits the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1. Thus, the combination of ABT-199 and BZB sensitizes STS cells to apoptosis by simultaneously releasing several defined apoptotic restraints. This synergistic mechanism of action was verified by CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out, showing that both BAX and NOXA are crucial for ABT-199/BZB-induced apoptosis. Noteworthy, efficient induction of apoptosis by ABT-199/BZB was not affected by the p53 status and invariably detected in cell lines and patient-derived tumor cells of several sarcoma types, including rhabdomyo-, leiomyo-, lipo-, chondro-, osteo-, or synovial sarcomas. Hence, we propose the combination of ABT-199 and BZB as a promising strategy for the treatment of STS, which should warrant further clinical investigation.",2020
32824972,Normoxic Tumour Extracellular Vesicles Modulate the Response of Hypoxic Cancer and Stromal Cells to Doxorubicin In Vitro.,"Extracellular vesicles (EV) secreted in the tumour microenvironment (TME) are emerging as major antagonists of anticancer therapies by orchestrating the therapeutic outcome through altering the behaviour of recipient cells. Recent evidence suggested that chemotherapeutic drugs could be responsible for the EV-mediated tumour-stroma crosstalk associated with cancer cell drug resistance. Here, we investigated the capacity of tumour EV (TEV) secreted by normoxic and hypoxic (1% oxygen) C26 cancer cells after doxorubicin (DOX) treatment to alter the response of naïve C26 cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages to DOX. We observed that C26 cells were less responsive to DOX treatment under normoxia compared to hypoxia, and a minimally cytotoxic DOX concentration that mounted distinct effects on cell viability was selected for TEV harvesting. Homotypic and heterotypic pretreatment of naïve hypoxic cancer and macrophage-like cells with normoxic DOX-elicited TEV rendered these cells slightly less responsive to DOX treatment. The observed effects were associated with strong hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) induction and B-cell lymphoma-extra-large anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-xL)-mediated anti-apoptotic response in normoxic DOX-treated TEV donor cells, being also tightly connected to the DOX-TEV-mediated HIF-1α induction, as well as Bcl-xL levels increasing in recipient cells. Altogether, our results could open new perspectives for investigating the role of chemotherapy-elicited TEV in the colorectal cancer TME and their modulatory actions on promoting drug resistance.",2020

32801295,Sequential combinations of chemotherapeutic agents with BH3 mimetics to treat rhabdomyosarcoma and avoid resistance.,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in childhood and adolescence. Refractory/relapsed RMS patients present a bad prognosis that combined with the lack of specific biomarkers impairs the development of new therapies. Here, we utilize dynamic BH3 profiling (DBP), a functional predictive biomarker that measures net changes in mitochondrial apoptotic signaling, to identify anti-apoptotic adaptations upon treatment. We employ this information to guide the use of BH3 mimetics to specifically inhibit BCL-2 pro-survival proteins, defeat resistance and avoid relapse. Indeed, we found that BH3 mimetics that selectively target anti-apoptotic BCL-xL and MCL-1, synergistically enhance the effect of clinically used chemotherapeutic agents vincristine and doxorubicin in RMS cells. We validated this strategy in vivo using a RMS patient-derived xenograft model and observed a reduction in tumor growth with a tendency to stabilization with the sequential combination of vincristine and the MCL-1 inhibitor S63845. We identified the molecular mechanism by which RMS cells acquire resistance to vincristine: an enhanced binding of BID and BAK to MCL-1 after drug exposure, which is suppressed by subsequently adding S63845. Our findings validate the use of DBP as a functional assay to predict treatment effectiveness in RMS and provide a rationale for combining BH3 mimetics with chemotherapeutic agents to avoid tumor resistance, improve treatment efficiency, and decrease undesired secondary effects.",2020

In this study, we used Vit K3 treatment combined with Ultraviolet radiation A (UVA) to produce photodynamic effects on cervical cancer.",2021
32788441,Oxidative stress battles neuronal Bcl-xL in a fight to the death.,"Bcl-xL is a pro-survival protein of the Bcl2 family found in the mitochondrial membrane. Bcl-xL supports growth, development, and maturation of neurons, and it also prevents neuronal death during neurotoxic stimulation. This article reviews the mechanisms and upstream signaling that regulate the activity and abundance of Bcl-xL. Our team and others have reported that oxidative stress is a key regulator of intracellular Bcl-xL balance in neurons. Oxidative stress regulates synthesis, degradation, and activity of Bcl-xL and therefore neuronal function. During apoptosis, pro-apoptotic Bcl2 proteins such as Bax and Bak translocate to and oligomerize in the mitochondrial membrane. Formation of oligomers causes release of cytochrome c and activation of caspases that lead to neuronal death. Bcl-xL binds directly to pro-apoptotic Bcl2 proteins to block apoptotic signaling. Although anti-apoptotic roles of Bcl-xL have been well documented, an increasing number of studies in recent decades show that protein binding partners of Bcl-xL are not limited to Bcl2 proteins. Bcl-xL forms a complex with F",2021

32763235,S-petasin induces apoptosis and inhibits cell migration through activation of p53 pathway signaling in melanoma B16F10 cells and A375 cells.,"Melanoma is a dangerous type of skin cancer that develops from the melanocytes. Activation of p53 in melanoma cells has been validated as a strategy for melanoma therapy. S-Petasin, a dietary sesquiterpene isolated from Petasites japonicus, has been shown to possess multiple biological effects. However, no studies have reported that s-petasin exerted anti-melanoma or inhibited activity in melanoma cells. We investigated the effect of s-petasin in B16F10 cells and A375 cells and the underlying molecular mechanism. S-Petasin exerted a significant anti-proliferation effect on B16F10 cells and A375 cells as measured by the MTT assay and crystal violet staining assay. S-Petasin induced cell apoptosis in B16F10 cells and A375 cells as evidenced by flow cytometry assay and western blot assay. Wound healing assay and transwell cell migration and invasion assay revealed that s-petasin suppressed B16F10 cells and A375 cells migration in vitro. For mechanism study, western blot assay indicated that s-petasin activated the p53 pathway signaling. Furthermore, expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-",2020
32721616,Let-7a inhibits Bcl-xl and YAP1 expression to induce apoptosis of trophoblast cells in early-onset severe preeclampsia.,"Dysregulation of the MicroRNA (miR) Let-7 family has been implicated in preeclampsia (PE). Abnormal trophoblast cell proliferation and apoptosis associate with the pathogenesis of PE. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis whether let-7a could regulate the biological functions of trophoblasts and explore the mechanism how it works in the development of early-onset severe PE. The putative target genes Bcl-xl and YAP1 of let-7a were verified by luciferase assay. The roles of let-7a, Bcl-xl and YAP1 in regulating JEG-3 cell functions were examined by altering their expression with mimic, overexpression plasmids or siRNAs. The methylation status of let-7a-3 in PE was assessed by methylation-specific and bisulfite sequencing PCR assays. JEG-3 cells were treated with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor to analyze whether let-7a-3 demethylation functioned in PE. Tumor growth and cell apoptosis were measured from nude mice inoculated with JEG-3 cells overexpressing let-7a. The results revealed let-7a was highly expressed in early-onset severe PE and let-7a-3 presented a low methylation level. Functionally, let-7a upregulation could inhibit the viability and cell cycle progression but induce the apoptosis of JEG-3 cells. Bcl-xl and YAP1, target genes of let-7a, could rescue cell apoptosis induced by let-7a. The demethylation of let-7a-3 was also observed to elevate the expression of let-7a and enhance JEG-3 cell apoptosis. Let-7a inhibited tumorigenic ability of JEG-3 cells and enhanced cell apoptosis in vivo. Altogether, let-7a could enhance cell apoptosis in trophoblasts through downregulation of Bcl-xl and YAP1, which suggests that let-7a might be a key regulator in the progression of PE.",2020
32708132,DLBCL Cells with Acquired Resistance to Venetoclax Are Not Sensitized to BIRD-2 But Can Be Resensitized to Venetoclax through Bcl-XL Inhibition.,"Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-family members are frequently dysregulated in both blood and solid cancers, contributing to their survival despite ongoing oncogenic stress. Yet, such cancer cells often are highly dependent on Bcl-2 for their survival, a feature that is exploited by so-called BH3-mimetic drugs. Venetoclax (ABT-199) is a selective BH3-mimetic Bcl-2 antagonist that is currently used in the clinic for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. Unfortunately, venetoclax resistance has already emerged in patients, limiting the therapeutic success. Here, we examined strategies to overcome venetoclax resistance. Therefore, we used two diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines, Riva WT and venetoclax-resistant Riva (VR). The latter was obtained by prolonged culturing in the presence of venetoclax. We report that Riva VR cells did not become more sensitive to BIRD-2, a peptide targeting the Bcl-2 BH4 domain, and established cross-resistance towards BDA-366, a putative BH4-domain antagonist of Bcl-2. However, we found that Bcl-XL, another Bcl-2-family protein, is upregulated in Riva VR, while Mcl-1 expression levels are not different in comparison with Riva WT, hinting towards an increased dependence of Riva VR cells to Bcl-XL. Indeed, Riva VR cells could be resensitized to venetoclax by A-1155463, a selective BH3 mimetic Bcl-XL inhibitor. This is underpinned by siRNA experiments, demonstrating that lowering Bcl-XL-expression levels also augmented the sensitivity of Riva VR cells to venetoclax. Overall, this work demonstrates that Bcl-XL upregulation contributes to acquired resistance of DLBCL cancer cells towards venetoclax and that antagonizing Bcl-XL can resensitize such cells towards venetoclax.",2020

In this study, we describe how fluorizoline induces BCL-2 homology 3-only protein NOXA, without modulating the protein levels of anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family members prior to caspase activation, as well as how it synergizes with the BCL-2 and BCL-X",2021
32648086,Lentivirus-Mediated Overexpression of SIVA-1 Reverses Cisplatin Resistance in Gastric Cancer in vitro.,"SIVA-1 plays a critical role in the induction of apoptosis in a number of different cell lines and participates in the mechanism of cisplatin (DDP)-mediated antitumor effects. However, the involvement of SIVA-1 in cisplatin resistance in gastric carcinoma has not been revealed. To explore the effect of SIVA-1 on DDP resistance, a recombinant pGV358-GFP-SIVA-1 lentiviral vector was constructed and transfected into human cisplatin-resistant MKN45/DDP gastric cancer cells. Subsequently, stable SIVA-1 overexpression was established in MKN45/DDP cells, which resulted in increased DDP sensitivity in MKN45/DDP cells in vitro. Flow cytometry demonstrated that SIVA-1 overexpression increased the percentage of apoptotic cells compared to that in the control. The colony formation assay clearly revealed that cell growth and proliferation were significantly suppressed following SIVA-1 overexpression. In addition, overexpression of SIVA-1 inhibited the migratory and invasive potential of MKN45/DDP cells in vitro. Western blot analysis indicated that SIVA-1 increased the expression levels of p53, p73, and p14ARF, whereas it reduced Bcl-2, MDM2, and Bcl-xL expression. In short, SIVA-1 upregulated the protein expression of p53, p73, and p14ARF and decreased that of Bcl-2, MDM2, and Bcl-xL in vitro and subsequently reversed cisplatin resistance in gastric cancer cells, suggesting that SIVA-1 serves as a valuable potential target for attenuating chemotherapy resistance.",2020
32645248,Gamma-irradiation-induced testicular oxidative stress and apoptosis: Mitigation by l-carnitine.,"The current study evaluated the potential ameliorative and protective impacts of l-carnitine (L-CAR) against γ-irradiation (RAD)-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in mice testes. Male Swiss mice were allocated into four groups (n = 7). Group 1 served as a control that received saline intraperitoneally (IP). Group 2 received L-CAR (10 mg/kg bw/day; IP in saline) for 17 days. Group 3 received saline for 17 days and on day 7 exposed to RAD at a dose of 0.1 Gy per day for consecutive 10 days. Group 4 (L-CAR + RAD), received L-CAR same as in group 2 and on day 7 exposed to RAD for consecutive 10 days. Testicular antioxidants (malondialdehyde, MDA; γ-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase, gGCS; and catalase) were altered by γ-irradiation. Preadministration of L-CAR protected γ-irradiated mice from altered changes induced by γ-irradiation. γ-Irradiation affected the mRNA expression of pro-apoptotic, apoptotic, and anti-apoptotic genes (c-jun, c-fos, Bcl-xl, caspase-3, and BAX). All altered genes were ameliorated by prior l-carnitine administration to γ-irradiated mice. Testicular cells showed deformities and edema with congestion in seminiferous tubules and strong immunoreactivity for caspase-9 and a decrease in immunoreactivity of Bcl-2 in histological and immunohistochemical examination. Prior administration of L-CAR to γ-irradiated mice protected this group from reported changes in caspase-9 and Bcl-2 immunostaining. In conclusion, the current study provides evidence for the protective and ameliorative impacts of L-CAR against γ-irradiation-induced testicular oxidative stress and apoptosis at biochemical, molecular, and cellular levels.",2020

32612157,Caspase dependent apoptosis is required for anterior regeneration in Aeolosoma viride and its related gene expressions are regulated by the Wnt signaling pathway.,"Although apoptosis has been widely observed during the regenerative process, the mechanisms by which it is regulated and its roles in regeneration remained unclear. In this study, we introduced Aeolosoma viride, a fresh water annelid with an extraordinary regenerative ability as our model organism to study the functions and regulations of apoptotic caspases. Here we showed that major events of apoptosis were detected near the wounded area and showed spatial correlation with the expression patterns of caspase gene namely Avi-caspase X and two apoptosis regulators namely Avi-Bax and Avi-Bcl-xL. Next, we investigated how Avi-caspase X gene expression and apoptosis influence regeneration following head amputation. RNA interference of Avi-caspase X reduced the amounts of apoptotic cells, as well as the percentage of successful regeneration, suggesting a critical role for apoptosis in anterior regeneration of A. viride. In addition, we also discovered that the expression of apoptotic caspases was regulated by the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Together, our study showed that caspase dependent apoptosis was critical to the anterior regeneration of A. viride, and could be regulated by the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.",2020
32583748,Long Noncoding RNA LINC00634 Functions as an Oncogene in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Through the miR-342-3p/Bcl2L1 Axis.,"Many long noncoding RNAs reportedly have tumor suppressive roles or are oncogenic in esophageal cancer. We have previously performed a chip-based expression analysis of primary esophageal cancer tissues and found that the expression of LINC00634 in these tissues was higher than that in nontumor tissues. Quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction, cell counting kit-8, flow cytometry, caspase3/7 assay, dual-luciferase reporter assay, and restore assay were used to detect the proliferative and apoptotic effects of LINC00634 in esophageal cancer cells. The results showed that the expression of LINC00634 in these tissues was higher than that in nontumor tissues and associated with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage of patients. Knockdown of LINC00634 decreased cell viability and increased cell apoptosis levels in EC9706 and EC1 cells. LINC00634 could target Bcl2L1 through miR-342-3p. In this study, we show that LINC00634 is upregulated in esophageal cancer. We also show that the knockdown of LINC00634 decreased cell viability and increased cell apoptosis levels in EC9706 and EC1 cells through the miR-342-3p/Bcl2L1 axis.",2020
32558932,"Low-Density Lipoproteins, High-Density Lipoproteins (HDL), and HDL-Associated Proteins Differentially Modulate Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Cell Viability.","Cellular lipid metabolism, lipoprotein interactions, and liver X receptor (LXR) activation have been implicated in the pathophysiology and treatment of cancer, although findings vary across cancer models and by lipoprotein profiles. In this study, we investigated the effects of human-derived low-density lipoproteins (LDL), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and HDL-associated proteins apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) and serum amyloid A (SAA) on markers of viability, cholesterol flux, and differentiation in K562 cells-a bone marrow-derived, stem-like erythroleukemia cell model of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We further evaluated whether lipoprotein-mediated effects were altered by concomitant LXR activation. We observed that LDL promoted higher K562 cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner and increased cellular cholesterol concentrations, while LXR activation by the agonist TO901317 ablated these effects. LXR activation in the presence of HDL, apoA1 and SAA-rich HDL suppressed K562 cell viability, while robustly inducing mRNA expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). HDL and its associated proteins additionally suppressed mRNA expression of anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma-extra large (BCL-xL), and the erythroid lineage marker 5'-aminolevulinate synthase 2 (ALAS2), while SAA-rich HDL induced mRNA expression of the megakaryocytic lineage marker integrin subunit alpha 2b (ITGA2B). Together, these findings suggest that lipoproteins and LXR may impact the viability and characteristics of CML cells.",2020

32464442,Curcumin alleviates arsenic-induced toxicity in PC12 cells via modulating autophagy/apoptosis.,"Arsenic is a recognized highly toxic contaminant, responsible for numerous human diseases and affecting many millions of people in different parts of the world. Contrarily, curcumin is a natural dietary polyphenolic compound and the main active ingredient in turmeric. Recently it has drawn great attention due to its diverse biological activities, strong antioxidant properties and therapeutic potential against many human ailments. In this study, we aimed to explore the protective effects and the regulatory role of curcumin on arsenic-induced toxicity and gain insights into biomolecular mechanism/s. Arsenic (10 μM) treatment in PC12 cells for 24 h induced cytotoxicity by decreasing cell viability and intracellular glutathione level and increasing lactate dehydrogenase activity and DNA fragmentation. In addition, arsenic caused apoptotic cell death in PC12 cells, which were confirmed from flow cytometry results. Moreover, arsenic (10 μM) treatment significantly down-regulated the inhibition factors of autophagy/apoptosis; mTOR, Akt, Nrf2, ERK1, Bcl-x, Xiap protein expressions, up-regulated the enhanced factors of autophagy/apoptosis; ULK, LC3, p53, Bax, cytochrome c, caspase 9, cleaved caspase 3 proteins and eventually caused autophagic and apoptotic cell death. However, curcumin (2.5 μM) pretreatment with arsenic (10 μM) effectively saves PC12 cells against arsenic-induced cytotoxicity through increasing cell viability, intracellular GSH level and boosting the antioxidant defense system, and limiting the LDH activity and DNA damage. Furthermore, pretreatment of curcumin with arsenic expressively alleviated arsenic-induced toxicity and cell death by reversing the expressions of proteins; mTOR, Akt, Nrf2, ERK1, Bcl-x, Xiap, ULK, LC3, p53, Bax, cytochrome c, caspase 9 and cleaved caspase 3. Our findings indicated that curcumin showed antioxidant properties through the Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathway and alleviates arsenic-triggered toxicity in PC12 cells by regulating autophagy/apoptosis.",2020
32457483,BH3 mimetics selectively eliminate chemotherapy-induced senescent cells and improve response in TP53 wild-type breast cancer.,"TP53 wild-type breast tumors rarely undergo a complete pathological response after chemotherapy treatment. These patients have an extremely poor survival rate and studies show these tumors preferentially undergo senescence instead of apoptosis. These senescent cells persist after chemotherapy and secrete cytokines and chemokines comprising the senescence associated secretory phenotype, which promotes survival, proliferation, and metastasis. We hypothesized that eliminating senescent tumor cells would improve chemotherapy response and extend survival. Previous studies have shown ""senolytic"" agents selectively kill senescent normal cells, but their efficacy in killing chemotherapy-induced senescent cancer cells is unknown. We show that ABT-263, a BH3 mimetic that targets antiapoptotic proteins BCL2/BCL-XL/BCL-W, had no effect on proliferating cells, but rapidly and selectively induced apoptosis in a subset of chemotherapy-treated cancer cells, though sensitivity required days to develop. Low NOXA expression conferred resistance to ABT-263 in some cells, necessitating additional MCL1 inhibition. Gene editing confirmed breast cancer cells relied on BCL-XL or BCL-XL/MCL1 for survival in senescence. In a mouse model of breast cancer, ABT-263 treatment following chemotherapy led to apoptosis, greater tumor regression, and longer survival. Our results reveal cancer cells that have survived chemotherapy by entering senescence can be eliminated using BH3 mimetic drugs that target BCL-XL or BCL-XL/MCL1. These drugs could help minimize residual disease and extend survival in breast cancer patients that otherwise have a poor prognosis and are most in need of improved therapies.",2020
32445837,The novel dual BET/HDAC inhibitor TW09 mediates cell death by mitochondrial apoptosis in rhabdomyosarcoma cells.,"Targeting the epigenome of cancer cells with the combination of Bromodomain and Extra Terminal (BET) protein inhibitors and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors has shown synergistic antitumor effects in several cancer types. In this study, we investigate the antitumor potential of the novel dual BET/HDAC inhibitor TW09 in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cells. TW09 reduces cell viability, suppresses long-term clonogenic survival and induces cell death in RMS cells in a dose-dependent manner. Compared to BET/HDAC co-inhibition using JQ1 and MS-275, TW09 induces similar cell death at equimolar concentrations and regulates BET and HDAC target proteins (e.g. c-MYC, H3 acetylation). Mechanistic studies revealed that TW09 upregulates BIM, NOXA, PUMA and BMF, while downregulating BCL-X",2020

32424151,BCL-xL/BCL2L1 is a critical anti-apoptotic protein that promotes the survival of differentiating pancreatic cells from human pluripotent stem cells.,"The differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into pancreatic cells involves cellular proliferation and apoptosis during cell fate transitions. However, their implications for establishing cellular identity are unclear. Here, we profiled the expression of BCL-2 family of proteins during pancreatic specification and observed an upregulation of BCL-xL, downregulation of BAK and corresponding downregulation of cleaved CASP3 representative of apoptosis. Experimental inhibition of BCL-xL reciprocally increased apoptosis and resulted in a decreased gene expression of pancreatic markers despite a compensatory increase in anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2. RNA-Seq analyses then revealed a downregulation of multiple metabolic genes upon inhibition of BCL-xL.

32423828,Identification of inhibitors of Bcl-2 family protein-protein interaction by combining the BRET screening platform with virtual screening.,"Bcl-2 family proteins play key roles in tumor initiation, progression, and resistance to therapy. Therefore, the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between the pro-survival proteins, B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 and Bcl-xL, and the pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax and Bak, could be attractive therapeutic targets for anti-cancer drug discovery. Here, we found new small molecules, BIP-A1001 and BIP-A2001 that modulated Bak/Bax and Bcl-xL interactions by combining the Nanoluc/YFP-based bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay with structure based virtual screening. In addition, we chose compounds with similar structures to BIP-A1001 and BIP-A2001 and tested their inhibitory effects using the BRET assay as a dose-response function. The results indicated that identifying compounds that inhibit interactions between Bak/Bax and Bcl-xL could be a promising approach to enhance cancer therapy.",2020

32397683,Neuroprotective Activity of ,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with an unclear cause. It appears that multiple factors participate in the process of neuronal damage including oxidative stress and accumulation of the protein amyloid β (Aβ) in the brain. The search for a treatment for this disorder is essential as current medications are limited to alleviating symptoms and palliative effects. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of mint extracts on selected mechanisms implicated in the development of AD. To enable a thorough investigation of mechanisms, including effects on β-secretase (the enzyme that leads to the formation of Aβ), on Aβ aggregation, and on oxidative stress and apoptosis pathways, a neuronal cell model, SH-SY5Y cells, was selected.

32396934,IKAROS and CK2 regulate expression of BCL-XL and chemosensitivity in high-risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"High-risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is an aggressive disease, often characterized by resistance to chemotherapy. A frequent feature of high-risk B-ALL is loss of function of the IKAROS (encoded by the IKZF1 gene) tumor suppressor. Here, we report that IKAROS regulates expression of the BCL2L1 gene (encodes the BCL-XL protein) in human B-ALL. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that IKAROS binds to the BCL2L1 promoter, recruits histone deacetylase HDAC1, and represses BCL2L1 expression via chromatin remodeling. In leukemia, IKAROS' function is impaired by oncogenic casein kinase II (CK2), which is overexpressed in B-ALL. Phosphorylation by CK2 reduces IKAROS binding and recruitment of HDAC1 to the BCL2L1 promoter. This results in a loss of IKAROS-mediated repression of BCL2L1 and increased expression of BCL-XL. Increased expression of BCL-XL and/or CK2, as well as reduced IKAROS expression, are associated with resistance to doxorubicin treatment. Molecular and pharmacological inhibition of CK2 with a specific inhibitor CX-4945, increases binding of IKAROS to the BCL2L1 promoter and enhances IKAROS-mediated repression of BCL2L1 in B-ALL. Treatment with CX-4945 increases sensitivity to doxorubicin in B-ALL, and reverses resistance to doxorubicin in multidrug-resistant B-ALL. Combination treatment with CX-4945 and doxorubicin show synergistic therapeutic effects in vitro and in preclinical models of high-risk B-ALL. Results reveal a novel signaling network that regulates chemoresistance in leukemia. These data lay the groundwork for clinical testing of a rationally designed, targeted therapy that combines the CK2 inhibitor, CX-4945, with doxorubicin for the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies.",2020

Bcl-2 and other BH3 family proteins are critically important in the process of apoptosis pathway, which may be a promising target. APG-1252-M1 specifically connects to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl. The antitumor effect of APG-1252-M1 in six gastric cancer cells was identified by the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. The expression level of proapoptotic proteins was evaluated by Western blot. Meanwhile, the cell cycle and apoptosis distributions were analyzed by flow cytometry and JC-1. Xenograft models were used to investigate the roles of APG-1252-M1 in suppressing the growth of tumors and enhancing the chemotherapy antitumor effect. The antitumor effect of APG-1252-M1 was time- and dose-dependent and acted by initiating apoptosis. The change of cell cycle distribution was not discovered in gastric cancer cells treated with APG-1252-M1. APG-1252-M1 also exhibited synergy with chemotherapy in vivo. The combined group inhibited xenograft tumor growth more obviously than the other groups. Moreover, Ki-67 was remarkably decreased in the combination group compared to other groups. In conclusion, APG-1252-M1 had a strong antitumor effect by inducing apoptosis and was synergistic with chemotherapy.",2020

Exercise is presumed to delay the aging process and promote health because it seems to improve the function of most of the aging mechanisms. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of swimming exercise training on brain inflammation, apoptotic and survival pathways in the hippocampus of D-galactose-induced aging in SD rats. The rats were allocated to the following groups: (1) control; (2) swimming exercise; (3) induced-aging by injecting D-galactose; (4) induced-aging rats with swimming exercise. The longevity-related AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α signaling pathway and brain IGF1/PI3K/Akt survival pathway were significantly reduced in D-galactose-induced aging group compared to non-aging control group and increased after exercise training. The inflammation pathway markers were over-expressed in induced-aging hippocampus, exercise significantly inhibited the inflammatory signaling activity. Fas-dependent and mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathways were significantly increased in the induced-aging group relative to the control group whereas they were decreased in the aging-exercise group. This study demonstrated that swimming exercise not only reduced aging-induced brain apoptosis and inflammatory signaling activity, but also enhanced the survival pathways in the hippocampus, which provides one of the new beneficial effects for exercise training in aging brain.",2020

HIT is caused by antibodies that recognize complexes of platelet factor 4 and heparin. The pathogenic mechanisms of this condition are not fully understood. In this study, we used flow cytometry, fluorimetry, and Western blot analysis to study the direct effects of pathogenic immune complexes containing platelet factor 4 on human platelets isolated by gel-filtration. HIT-like pathogenic immune complexes initially caused pronounced activation of platelets detected by an increased expression of phosphatidylserine and P-selectin. This activation was mediated either directly through the FcγRIIA receptors or indirectly via protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) receptors due to thrombin generated on or near the surface of activated platelets. The immune activation was later followed by the biochemical signs of cell death, such as mitochondrial membrane depolarization, up-regulation of Bax, down-regulation of Bcl-X",2020

Fluorouracil (5-FU) is currently used as an anticancer drug for leukemia patients. Casticin, a natural polymethoxyflavone, exerts anticancer activity against many human cancer cell lines in vitro, but no other reports show 5-FU combined with casticin increased the mouse leukemia cell apoptosis in vitro. Herein, the antileukemia activity of 5-FU combined with casticin in WEHI-3 mouse leukemia cells was investigated in vitro. Treatment of two-drug combination had a higher decrease in cell viability and a higher increase in apoptotic cell death, the level of DNA condensation, and the length of comet tail than that of 5-FU or casticin treatment alone in WEHI-3 cells.

32260403,The Role of Bcl-xL Protein Research in Veterinary Oncology.,"Due to their significant impact on human and animal health, cancer diseases are an area of considerable concern for both human and veterinary medicine. Research on the cancer pathogenesis in companion animals, such as dogs, allows not only for improving canine cancer treatment, but also for translating the results into human oncology. Disruption of apoptosis in tumor-transformed cells is a well-known mechanism leading to the development of cancer. One of the main factors involved in this process are proteins belonging to the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family, and the imbalance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic members of this family contributes to the development of cancer. Studies on the function of these proteins, including B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL), have also been intensively conducted in companion animals. The Bcl-xL gene was sequenced and found to share over 99% homology with the human protein. Research showed that the Bcl-2 family plays the same role in human and canine cells, and data from studies in dogs are fully translatable to other species, including humans. The role of this protein family in cancer development was also confirmed. The article presents the current state of knowledge on the importance of the Bcl-xL protein in veterinary oncology.",2020

32189339,Correction of Bcl-x splicing improves responses to imatinib in chronic myeloid leukaemia cells and mouse models.,"Imatinib mesylate (IM) resistance has become a major clinical problem for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). It is known that Bcl-x splicing is deregulated and is involved in multiple malignant cancer initiation and chemotherapy resistance, including CML. The aim of the present study was to correct the abnormal splicing of Bcl-x in CML and investigate the subsequent malignant phenotype changes, especially response to IM. The aberrant Bcl-x splicing in CML cells was effectively restored using vivo-Morpholino Antisense Oligomer (vMO). CCK-8 cell viability assay and flow cytometry showed that restoring of Bcl-x splicing increases IM-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis of K562 cells. Moreover, a more significant similar phenomenon was observed in imatinib-resistant CML cell lines K562/G01. Finally, establishment of CML xenograft model had also proved that correcting Bcl-x splicing in vivo can also enhance the anti-tumor effect of IM. Our findings suggest that vMO co-operating with IM can effectively increase the sensitivity of CML cells to IM both in vitro and in vivo, and Bcl-x splicing could become good candidates for chemotherapy-sensitized target in IM-resistant CML.",2020

32165235,Thymoquinone induces apoptosis of human renal carcinoma Caki-1 cells by inhibiting JAK2/STAT3 through pro-oxidant effect.,"Currently, there are limited effective treatment options for renal cell carcinoma (RCC), due to its poor responses to conventional therapies. Instead of using extrinsic anti-cancer drugs, cancer cell-intrinsic reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be a weapon of RCC treatment. In the present study, we found that the phytochemical thymoquinone (TQ), a bioactive natural product obtained from the black cumin seeds of Nigella sativa, generates intracellular ROS in human renal cancer Caki-1 cells. Treatment of Caki-1 cells with high concentration of TQ up-regulated pro-apoptotic p53 and Bax expression, while downregulated anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl expression. Simultaneously, TQ suppressed the pro-oncogenic JAK2/STAT3 pathway, resulting in decreased expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, cyclin D1, cyclin D2, and survivin. Thus, TQ can integrate between apoptosis and the pro-survival JAK2/STAT3 pathway through the Bcl family members, collectively magnifying Caki-1 cell apoptosis. However, treatment with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine significantly blocked TQ-induced apoptosis as well as incorporated signaling pathways, supporting that its pro-oxidant property is crucial for Caki-1 cell apoptosis. Moreover, TQ reduced the tumor xenograft growth of Caki-1 cells in nude mice. Taken together, these data suggest that TQ is a prominent anti-cancer drug to treat human RCC by enhancing apoptosis through its pro-oxidant nature.",2020

A novel expression vector containing STAT3 enhancer sequence and NanoLuc (NLuc) reporter gene sequence was constructed by gene recombination technology, then a cell line expressing NLuc luciferase and regulated by STAT3 was further established. The cell line was used to quantitatively detect the regulatory effects of various traditional Chinese medicine monomers on the IL-6/STAT3 signal pathway. The effects of the traditional Chinese medicine monomers inhibiting the IL-6/STAT3 signal pathway were verified by Western blotting immunoassay and Real-time PCR analysis. By enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing analysis, it showed that the reporter gene expression vector pQCXIP-STAT3-Nluc was constructed successfully. The addition of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a stimulator of STAT3 transcription factor, to the constructed cell line specifically enhanced the luciferase enzymatic reaction in a dose dependent manner. These results demonstrated that the cell line expressing NLuc luciferase and regulated by STAT3 has been constructed successfully. We used the the cell line screened out dendrobiine and tetrandrine which could significantly inhibit IL-6/STAT3 signal pathway and down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, we have constructed an efficient reporter gene system to detect the transcriptional activity of STAT3, by which the Chinese medicine monomers inhibiting IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway were successfully screened out, which has some potential theoretical and practical values.",2020

Therefore, it seems that combination therapy through targeting more than one cancer-related factor may lead to cancer control. The expression and function of p68 (DDX5; DEAD-Box Helicase 5) are dysregulated in various cancers. P68 is also a co-activator of many oncogenic transcription factors such as the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), which contributes to cancer progression.

32125664,Varicella-Zoster Virus infected human neurons are resistant to apoptosis.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a pathogenic human herpesvirus that causes varicella (chickenpox) as a primary infection following which it becomes latent in ganglionic neurons. Following viral reactivation many years later VZV causes herpes zoster (shingles) as well as a variety of other neurological syndromes. The molecular mechanisms of the conversion of the virus from a lytic to a latent state in ganglia are not well understood. In order to gain insights into the neuron-virus interaction, we studied virus-induced apoptosis in cultures of both highly pure terminally differentiated human neurons and human fetal lung fibroblasts (HFL). It was found that (a) VZV DNA did not accumulate in infected human neurons; (b) VZV transcripts were present at lower levels at all days studied post-infection in neurons; (c) Western blot analysis showed less VZV IE 63 and very little detectable VZV gE proteins in infected neurons compared with HFL; (d) lower levels of the apoptotic marker cleaved Caspase-3 protein were detected in VZV-infected neurons compared with HFL, and higher levels of the known anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl2, Bcl-XL and also the mitochondrial MT-CO2 protein were found in VZV-infected neurons compared with uninfected cells; and (e) both the MT-CO2 protein and VZV IE 63-encoded protein were detected in infected neurons by dual immunofluorescence. These findings showed that neurons are resistant to VZV-induced apoptosis, which may have relevance to the switching of VZV from a lytic to latent ganglionic neuronal infection.",2020

32088314,Bcl-xL inhibits PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy by preventing mitochondrial Parkin accumulation.,"This report aims to explore how Bcl-xL, a Bcl-2 family protein, regulates PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy. Compared with the Hela cells expressing Parkin alone, co-expression of Bcl-xL significantly inhibited CCCP (Carbonyl cyanide 3- chlorophenylhydrazone)-induced mitochondrial Parkin accumulation and mitophagy. Western blotting analysis illustrated that over-expressed Bcl-xL inhibited CCCP-induced decrease of mitochondrial proteins in Parkin over-expressed cells. Fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) analyses demonstrated that Bcl-xL inhibited the CCCP-induced translocation of Parkin into mitochondria not by retrotranslocating Parkin from mitochondria to cytoplasm. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging revealed in Hela cells that Bcl-xL physically bound with Parkin to form oligomer in cytoplasm, and that Bcl-xL also directly interacted with PINK1 on mitochondria. analysis for HEK293 T cells verified that endogenous Bcl-xL interacted with both endogenous Parkin and PINK1. Collectively, Bcl-xL inhibits PINK1/Parkin- dependent mitophagy by preventing the accumulation of Parkin on mitochondria via two regulation ways: directly binds to Parkin in cytoplasm to prevent the translocation of Parkin from cytoplasm to mitochondria and directly binds to PINK1 on mitochondria to inhibit the Parkin from cytoplasm to mitochondria by PINK1.",2020
32066881,The apoptosis inhibitor Bcl-xL controls breast cancer cell migration through mitochondria-dependent reactive oxygen species production.,"The Bcl-xL apoptosis inhibitor plays a major role in vertebrate development. In addition to its effect on apoptosis, Bcl-xL is also involved in cell migration and mitochondrial metabolism. These effects may favour the onset and dissemination of metastasis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be fully understood. Here we focus on the control of cell migration by Bcl-xL in the context of breast cancer cells. We show that Bcl-xL silencing led to migration defects in Hs578T and MDA-MB231 cells. These defects were rescued by re-expressing mitochondria-addressed, but not endoplasmic reticulum-addressed, Bcl-xL. The use of BH3 mimetics, such as ABT-737 and WEHI-539 confirmed that the effect of Bcl-xL on migration did not depend on interactions with BH3-containing death accelerators such as Bax or BH3-only proteins. In contrast, the use of a BH4 peptide that disrupts the Bcl-xL/VDAC1 complex supports that Bcl-xL by acting on VDAC1 permeability contributes to cell migration through the promotion of reactive oxygen species production by the electron transport chain. Collectively our data highlight the key role of Bcl-xL at the interface between cell metabolism, cell death, and cell migration, thus exposing the VDAC1/Bcl-xL interaction as a promising target for anti-tumour therapy in the context of metastatic breast cancer.",2020

32027929,"Acute administration of perampanel, an AMPA receptor antagonist, reduces cognitive impairments after traumatic brain injury in rats.","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and physical as well as cognitive disability for which an effective treatment option remains to be identified. Evidence in preclinical models has indicated that antagonists of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isozazole propionate (AMPA) receptor exert neuroprotective effects after mechanical injury in vitro and in vivo. In particular, 2-(2-oxo-1-phenyl-5-pyridin-2-yl-1,2-dihydropyridin-3-yl)benzonitrile hydrate (perampanel), a selective AMPA receptor antagonist with good bioavailability, was recently shown to therapeutically protect against the sequelae of TBI in the rodent controlled cortical impact model. However, this model induces a largely focal injury and is less representative of diffuse injury components that occur in TBI resulting from acceleration/deceleration forces. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of perampanel in the rodent lateral fluid percussion injury model (LFPI), which produces both focal and diffuse injury. Pre- or post-injury administration of perampanel in male adult rats attenuated the injury-induced increase in the pro-apoptotic bax/bcl-xL ratio in the hippocampus; reduced impairments in learning and memory, assessed by the Morris water maze test; and reduced impairments in reward-seeking behavior, assessed by a female encounter test. Although additional studies are needed to determine the sex-related differences in the neuroprotective effects, these results provide support for the therapeutic potential of perampanel in TBI.",2020

This effect on AML is accomplished through deregulation of several critical genes, such as B cell lymphoma-extra-large (BCL-XL) which is anti-apoptotic protein. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of curcumin (CUR) and thalidomide (THAL) on apoptosis induction and also the alteration of the mRNA expression level of STAT3 and BCL-XL mRNA on AML cell line compounds.",2020
31999645,Genetic modification increases the survival and the neuroregenerative properties of transplanted neural stem cells.,"Cell therapy raises hopes high for better treatment of brain disorders. However, the majority of transplanted cells often die soon after transplantation, and those that survive initially continue to die in the subacute phase, diminishing the impact of transplantations. In this study, we genetically modified transplanted human neural stem cells (hNSCs), from 2 distant embryonic stem cell lines (H9 and RC17), to express 1 of 4 prosurvival factors - Hif1a, Akt1, Bcl-2, or Bcl-xl - and studied how these modifications improve short- and long-term survival of transplanted hNSCs. All genetic modifications dramatically increased survival of the transplanted hNSCs. Importantly, 3 out of 4 modifications also enhanced the exit of hNSCs from the cell cycle, thus avoiding aberrant growth of the transplants. Bcl-xl expression provided the strongest protection of transplanted cells, reducing both immediate and delayed cell death, and stimulated hNSC differentiation toward neuronal and oligodendroglial lineages. By designing hNSCs with drug-controlled expression of Bcl-xl, we demonstrated that short-term expression of a prosurvival factor can ensure the long-term survival of transplanted cells. Importantly, transplantation of Bcl-xl-expressing hNSCs into mice suffering from stroke improved behavioral outcome and recovery of motor activity in mice.",2020

BH3-mimetics have recently gained a lot of popularity in oncology because of their success in cancer treatment. However, BH3-mimetics might have a broader clinical application. Here, we established an ex vivo flow cytometric assay allowing the comparison of the impact of BH3-mimetics (ABT-199, ABT-263, WEHI-539, and S63845) on leukocyte populations of both, healthy human subjects and C57BL/6 J wild type mice. BH3-mimetics were added to freshly drawn blood that was diluted 1/2 in cell medium, and BH3-mimetics-mediated impact on leukocyte count was assessed by flow cytometry. Our results demonstrate that responses towards 1μM of BH3-mimetics can be identical as well as considerably different in leukocytes of humans and mice. For instance, the inhibition of BCL-2 by ABT-199 caused cell death in all types of lymphocytes in mice but was exclusively specific for B cells in humans. Moreover, inhibition of BCL-X",2020
31936510,"BCL-xL, a Mitochondrial Protein Involved in Successful Aging: From ","B-Cell Lymphoma-extra-large (BCL-xL) is involved in longevity and successful aging, which indicates a role for BCL-xL in cell survival pathway regulation. Beyond its well described role as an inhibitor of apoptosis by preventing cytochrome c release, BCL-xL has also been related, indirectly, to autophagy and senescence pathways. Although in these latter cases, BCL-xL has dual roles, either activating or inhibiting, depending on the cell type and the specific conditions. Taken together, all these findings suggest a precise mechanism of action for BCL-xL, able to regulate the crosstalk between apoptosis, autophagy, and senescence, thus promoting cell survival or cell death. All three pathways can be both beneficial or detrimental depending on the circumstances. Thus, targeting BCL-xL would in turn be a ""double-edge sword"" and therefore, additional studies are needed to better comprehend this dual and apparently contradictory role of BCL-XL in longevity.",2020
31934113,IE86 Inhibits the apoptosis and promotes the cell proliferation of glioma cells via the hnRNP A2/B1-mediated alternative splicing of Bcl-x.,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a ubiquitous pathogen, can cause severe illness in immunocompromised individuals. Typically, glioma is one of the most common malignant primary brain tumors and originates in the central nervous system. The IE86 gene of HCMV exerts a major role in regulating virus replication. By using coimmunoprecipitation combined with mass spectrometry, the components of the IE86 complex were identified, and the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (hnRNP A2/B1) was recognized as one of the IE86 complex components. hnRNP A2/B1 is highly expressed in U251 cells, and the data suggest that IE86 can promote hnRNP A2/B1 expression. Furthermore, the knockdown of hnRNP A2/B1 significantly attenuates IE86-mediated apoptosis and cell proliferation. Importantly, IE86 can also inhibit the alternative splicing of Bcl-x by decreasing the Bcl-xS/Bcl-xL ratio, which is closely related to apoptosis. Meanwhile, the knockdown of hnRNP A2/B1 can mitigate the inhibitory effect of IE86 on the alternative splicing of Bcl-x. In conclusion, the inhibition of apoptosis and enhancement of cell proliferation by IE86 may be related to the hnRNP A2/B1-mediated alternative splicing of Bcl-x.",2019

Increased angiogenesis and resistance to apoptosis have been suggested to be involved in pathogenesis and development of endometriosis. The objective of this study was to examine apoptosis potential and angiogenesis contribution of eutopic (EuESCs) and ectopic (EESCs) endometrial stromal cells in patients with endometriosis compared to endometrial stromal cells from non-endometriotic controls (CESCs).",2020
31905614,Alpha-Tocotrienol Prevents Oxidative Stress-Mediated Post-Translational Cleavage of Bcl-xL in Primary Hippocampal Neurons.,"B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL) is an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl2 family of proteins, which supports neurite outgrowth and neurotransmission by improving mitochondrial function. During excitotoxic stimulation, however, Bcl-xL undergoes post-translational cleavage to ∆N-Bcl-xL, and accumulation of ∆N-Bcl-xL causes mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal death. In this study, we hypothesized that the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during excitotoxicity leads to formation of ∆N-Bcl-xL. We further proposed that the application of an antioxidant with neuroprotective properties such as α-tocotrienol (TCT) will prevent ∆N-Bcl-xL-induced mitochondrial dysfunction via its antioxidant properties. Primary hippocampal neurons were treated with α-TCT, glutamate, or a combination of both. Glutamate challenge significantly increased cytosolic and mitochondrial ROS and ∆N-Bcl-xL levels. ∆N-Bcl-xL accumulation was accompanied by intracellular ATP depletion, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and cell death. α-TCT prevented loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in hippocampal neurons overexpressing ∆N-Bcl-xL, suggesting that ∆N-Bcl-xL caused the loss of mitochondrial function under excitotoxic conditions. Our data suggest that production of ROS is an important cause of ∆N-Bcl-xL formation and that preventing ROS production may be an effective strategy to prevent ∆N-Bcl-xL-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and thus promote neuronal survival.",2019

Recent efforts have focused on developing therapies that target specific protein products of aberrantly expressed genes. However, many of the identified proteins are difficult to target and thought to be ""undrugable"" because of structural challenges, protein overexpression, or mutations that confer resistance to therapy. A novel technology that circumvents some of these issues is the use of small molecules that stabilize secondary DNA structures present in the promoters of many potential oncogenes and modulate their transcription.",2019
31880530,Relationship between Erk1/2 signal pathway and nerve cell apoptosis rats with ischemic stroke.,"To investigate the relationship between the Erk1/2 signal pathway and neuronal apoptosis in ischemic stroke rats. Male SD(Sprague Dawley)  rats (n = 24) were randomly divided into three groups, each containing 8 rats: sham-operated group, MCAO(Midle cerebral artery oclusion)  group, and MCAO + U0126 intervention group (U0126 group). In in vitro trial, primary cortical nerve cells were divided into three groups: control group, OGD(Oxygen and glucose deprivation)  group, and U0126 intervention group (U0126 group). In vivo protein expression levels of Erk1/2, p-Erk1/2 and Bcl-2 were determined using western blot. The expressions of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and Bax were assayed using immunohistochemical staining. Nerve cell mortality in cerebral tissue was detected using TUNEL staining. In in vitro trials, cell apoptosis was assayed with flow cytometry and LDH release. The activity of caspase-3 was determined. Nerve cell apoptosis was determined using Hoechst33258 staining method. In in vivo trial, it was found that the protein expression level of p-ERK1/2 in cerebral tissue in the MCAO group was significantly increased, when compared with that of the sham-operated group, while the protein expression level of p-Erk1/2 in the U0126 group was significantly lower than that in the MCAO group. The expression levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl in the MCAO group were significantly lower than the corresponding expression levels in the sham-operated group, while the expressions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl in the U0126 group were significantly lower than those in MCAO group. In MCAO group, the expression of Bax was significantly higher than that in the sham-operated group, while Bax expression was higher in U0126 than in MCAO group. There were significantly higher number of dead nerve cells in MCAO group than in the sham-operated group, while nerve cell mortality in U0126 group was significantly lower than in MCAO group. In in vitro trials, flow cytometry revealed significantly higher apoptosis of OGD-treated nerve cells, relative to the control group. Nerve cells exposed to U0126 and treated with ODR (Oxygen-dependent repressor)  were significantly decreased in population, when compared with single OGD treatment group. The LDH release level of nerve cells treated OGD was significantly increased, when compared with that of the control group. However, LDH release level of nerve cells treated with OGD after U0126 intervention was significantly decreased, relative to the single OGD treatment group. The dilution of nerve cell nucleus after OGD treatment was significantly increased, when compared with that of the control group. For nerve cells treated with ODR after U0126 intervention, the nuclear dilution was significantly decreased, relative to that of nerve cell nucleus in the single OGD treatment group. The OGD treatment led to significant increase in nerve cell caspase-3 activity, relative the control group. However, the caspase-3 activity of nerve cells treated with ODR after U0126 intervention was significantly decreased, when compared with single OGD treatment group. The activation of Erk1/2 signal pathway during ischemic stroke promotes apoptosis of nerve cells. Based on these findings, it can be reasonably inferred that the ERK1/2 signal pathway may be an important target for treating ischemic stroke.",2019
31870784,Glucocorticoids uncover a critical role for ASH2L on BCL-X expression regulation in leukemia cells.,"Targeting the apoptosis machinery is a promising therapeutic approach in myeloid malignancies. BCL2L1 is a well-known glucocorticoid-responsive gene and a key apoptosis regulator that, when over-expressed, can contribute to tumor development, progression and therapeutic resistance. Moreover, synthetic glucocorticoids, like dexamethasone, are frequently used in the treatment of hematopoietic diseases due to its pro-apoptotic properties. We report here that the trithorax protein ASH2L, considered one of the core subunits of H3K4-specific MLL/SET methyltransferase complexes, contributes to anti-apoptotic BCL-X",2020
31862959,The BET inhibitor GS-5829 targets chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and their supportive microenvironment.,"Despite major improvements in treatment outcome with novel targeted therapies, such as the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains incurable in the majority of patients. Activation of PI3K, NF-κB, and/or MYC has been linked to residual disease and/or resistance in ibrutinib-treated patients. These pathways can be targeted by inhibitors of bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins. Here we report about the preclinical activity of GS-5829, a novel BET inhibitor, in CLL. GS-5829 inhibited CLL cell proliferation and induced leukemia cell apoptosis through deregulation of key signaling pathways, such as BLK, AKT, ERK1/2, and MYC. IκBα modulation indicates that GS-5829 also inhibited NF-κB signaling. GS-5829-induced apoptosis resulted from an imbalance between positive (BIM) and negative regulators (BCL-X",2020
31838946,Transcriptomic analysis of patients with immune thrombocytopenia treated with eltrombopag.,"In the last years, the use of thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RA), eltrombopag and romiplostim, has improved the management of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Moreover, eltrombopag is also active in patients with aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. However, their mechanisms of action and signaling pathways still remain controversial. In order to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying eltrombopag therapy, a gene expression profile (GEP) analysis in patients treated with this drug was carried out. Fourteen patients with chronic ITP were studied by means of microarrays before and during eltrombopag treatment. Median age was 78 years (range, 35-87 years); median baseline platelet count was 14 × 10",2020

31801186,Heterogeneous Pattern of Dependence on Anti-Apoptotic BCL-2 Family Proteins upon CHOP Treatment in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.,"Expression of the anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) protein in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) strongly correlates with resistance to standard therapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, prednisolone, and rituximab (R-CHOP). Although studies focus mainly on the contribution of BCL-2, here we also investigate the contribution of other anti-apoptotic proteins to CHOP-therapy resistance in DLBCL. Functional dynamic BCL-2 homology (BH)3 profiling was applied to DLBCL cell lines upon CHOP treatment or single CHOP compounds. Cell-specific anti-apoptotic dependencies were validated with corresponding BH3-mimetics. We found high expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2, MCL-1, and BCL-XL in DLBCL cell lines and patients. CHOP treatment resulted in both enhanced and altered anti-apoptotic dependency. Enhanced sensitivity to different BH3-mimetics after CHOP treatment was confirmed in specific cell lines, indicating heterogeneity of CHOP-induced resistance in DLBCL. Analysis of single CHOP compounds demonstrated that similar changes could also be induced by doxorubicin or vincristine, providing evidence for clinical combination therapies of doxorubicin or vincristine with BH3-mimetics in DLBCL. In conclusion, we show for the first time that CHOP treatment induces increased anti-apoptotic dependency on MCL-1 and BCL-XL, and not just BCL-2. These results provide new perspectives for the treatment of CHOP-resistant DLBCL and underline the potential of BH3 profiling in predicting therapy outcomes.",2019

31786496,Investigating the protective actions of D-pinitol against arsenic-induced toxicity in PC12 cells and the underlying mechanism.,"Arsenic is awfully toxic metalloid responsible for many human diseases all over the world. Contrastingly, D-pinitol is a naturally occurring bioactive dietary compound has antioxidant properties. The objective of this study is to elucidate the protective actions of D-pinitol on arsenic-induced cytotoxicity and explore its controlling role in biomolecular mechanisms in PC12 cells. Obtained results demonstrated that co-exposure of D-pinitol with arsenic increases cell viability, decreases DNA damage and protects PC12 cells from arsenic-induced cytotoxicity by increasing glutathione (GSH) level and glutathione reductase (GR). Protein expression of western blot analysis showed that co-exposure of D-pinitol and arsenic significantly inhibited arsenic-induced autophagy which further suppressed apoptosis through up-regulation of survival factors; mTOR, p-mTOR, Akt, p-Akt, NF-кB, Nrf2, ERK1, GR, Bcl-x and down-regulation of death factors; p53, Bax, cytochrome c, LC3, although arsenic regulated those factors negatively. These results of this study suggested that D-pinitol protects PC12 cells from arsenic-induced cytotoxicity.",2020
31758295,Maackia amurensis agglutinin induces apoptosis in cultured drug resistant human non-small cell lung cancer cells.,"The emergence of multi drug resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is a major challenge towards the efficacy of chemotherapy. Thus, there is an urgent need for the newer, better clinically targeted strategies to treat this disease. Earlier studies from our laboratory revealed the apoptotic activity of Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA) in human NSCLC cells. In this study, the effect of MAA on drug resistant NSCLC cells was investigated. Two Paclitaxel-resistant NSCLC sub-lines (A549/PTX100 and NCI-H460/PTX100) were developed from A549 & NCI-H460 cell lines respectively. The generation of drug resistance phenotype was confirmed by the expression of cell surface MDR-1. Both the drug resistant sub-lines showed distinct morphological alterations.

31754664,Utilizing PROTAC technology to address the on-target platelet toxicity associated with inhibition of BCL-X,"BCL-XL, an anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein, plays a key role in cancer cell survival. However, the potential of BCL-XL as an anti-cancer target has been hampered by the on-target platelet toxicity because platelets depend on BCL-XL to maintain their viability. Here we report the development of a PROTAC BCL-XL degrader, XZ424, which has increased selectivity for BCL-XL-dependent MOLT-4 cells over human platelets compared with conventional BCL-XL inhibitors. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the potential of utilizing a PROTAC approach to achieve tissue selectivity.",2019
31751869,"Inhibiting the expression of anti-apoptotic genes BCL2L1 and MCL1, and apoptosis induction in glioblastoma cells by microRNA-342.","Glioma is an aggressive and lethal type of brain tumor that originates from glial cells. Glioblastoma cells confer considerable resistance to induction of apoptosis, which may be due to overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins, or the reduction of the level of some pro-apoptotic proteins. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can affect the cell biology pathways, including replication, autophagy, necrosis, and apoptosis by regulating gene expression. In this study, using bioinformatics methods, we selected the anti-apoptotic genes, BCL2L1 and MCL1, and microRNA that targeted them (miR-342). In the next step, the Lentiviral particles that contain miR-342 (LV-miR-342) were synthesized in HEK293T cell lines. Glioblastoma cell lines, U251 and U87, were transduced with LV-miR-342. The gene expression and apoptosis induction were then assayed by real-time PCR and flow cytometry respectively. The present study showed that increasing the expression of miR-342 reduced the expression of the anti-apoptotic genes, BCL2L1 and MCL1. The results of luciferase assay reports confirmed that miR-342 targeted BCL2L1 and MCL1. In addition, flow cytometry analysis indicated that miR-342 overexpression induced apoptosis in glioblastoma cells. As well as, Western blotting results confirmed a decrease in BCL2L1 protein following overexpression of miR-342 in glioblastoma cells. These findings may provide a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of glioblastoma.",2020

31683603,HOXA9 Transcriptionally Promotes Apoptosis and Represses Autophagy by Targeting NF-κB in Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,"Tumor suppressor HOXA9 has been identified to promote apoptosis in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). However, the mechanism of such pro-apoptotic role of HOXA9 remains obscure. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis of RNA-seq data showed that NF-κB, apoptosis and autophagy pathways are significantly regulated after HOXA9 knockdown. HOXA9 transcriptionally regulates RELA, the p65 subunit of NF-κB. Loss of HOXA9 in cSCC significantly upregulates RELA expression and thus enhances NF-κB pathway. Interestingly, RELA transcriptionally promotes not only anti-apoptotic factor BCL-XL but also autophagic genes including ATG1, ATG3, and ATG12. Our results reveal an enhanced NF-κB signaling network regulated by HOXA9, which contributes to repressed apoptosis and activated autophagy in cSCC development and may represent an intervention target for cSCC therapy.",2019

31671779,The Molecular Effects of Sulforaphane and Capsaicin on Metabolism upon Androgen and Tip60 Activation of Androgen Receptor.,"Androgen receptor (AR) stimulators, such as androgen and Tip60, play a pivotal role in prostatic carcinogenesis as androgen receptor signaling is critical for the growth and transformation of the prostate gland. Moreover, androgen and Tip60 promotes HIF-1α activation, involved in metabolic reprogramming by increasing glycolysis, a hallmark in cancer initiation and development. In this study we evaluated the effect of androgen and Tip60 stimulus in AR pathway activation and HIF-1α stabilization, in terms of proliferation and cell metabolism in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells. The protective role of the bioactive compounds sulforaphane and capsaicin against the effect of these stimuli leading to pro-carcinogenic features was also addressed. Sulforaphane and capsaicin decreased nuclear AR, prostate specific antigen and Bcl-XL levels, and cell proliferation induced by androgen and Tip60 in LNCaP cells. These bioactive compounds prevented the increase in glycolysis, hexokinase and pyruvate kinase activity, and reduced HIF-1α stabilization induced by androgen and Tip60 in LNCaP cells. The protective role of sulforaphane and capsaicin on prostate cancer may rely on mechanisms involving the inhibition of Tip60, AR and HIF-1α effects.",2019
31653826,PROTAC induced-BET protein degradation exhibits potent anti-osteosarcoma activity by triggering apoptosis.,"Targeting oncogenic proteins for degradation using proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) recently has drawn increasing attention in the field of cancer research. Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family proteins are newly identified cancer-related epigenetic regulators, which have a role in the pathogenesis and progression of osteosarcoma. In this study, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo anti-osteosarcoma activity by targeting BET with a PROTAC molecule BETd-260. The results showed that BETd-260 completely depletes BET proteins and potently suppresses cell viability in MNNG/HOS, Saos-2, MG-63, and SJSA-1 osteosarcoma cell lines. Compared with BET inhibitors HJB-97 and JQ1, the activity of BETd-260 increased over 1000 times. Moreover, BETd-260 substantially inhibited the expression of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1, Bcl-xl while increased the expression of pro-apoptotic Noxa, which resulted in massive apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells within hours. In addition, pro-oncogenic protein c-Myc also was substantially inhibited by BETd-260 in the OS cells. Of note, BETd-260 induced degradation of BET proteins, triggered apoptosis in xenograft osteosarcoma tumor tissue, and profoundly inhibited the growth of cell-derived and patient-derived osteosarcoma xenografts in mice. Our findings indicate that BET PROTACs represent a promising therapeutic agent for human osteosarcoma.",2019
31648320,BCL2L1 is associated with γ-globin gene expression.,"Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression is partially governed by the trans-acting quantitative trait loci BCL11A and MYB and a cis-acting locus linked to the HBB gene cluster. Our previous analysis of the Genotype-Tissue Expression database suggested that BCL2L1 was associated with HbF gene expression. In erythroid progenitors from patients with sickle cell disease, BCL2L1 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were positively correlated with HBG mRNA and total HbF concentration (r2 = 0.72, P = .047 and r2 = 0.68, P = .01, respectively). Inhibition of BCL2L1 protein activity in HbF-expressing HUDEP-1 cells decreased HBG expression in a dose-dependent manner. Overexpression of BCL2L1 in these cells increased HBG expression fourfold (P < .05) and increased F cells by 13% (P < .05). Overexpression of BCL2L1 in erythroid progenitors derived from primary adult CD34+ cells upregulated HBG expression 11-fold (P < .05), increased F cells by 18% (P < .01), did not significantly affect cell differentiation or proliferation, and had a minor effect on survival. Although the mechanism remains unknown, our results suggest that BCL2L1 is associated with HbF gene activation.",2019
31638265,BH3 profiling discriminates the anti‑apoptotic status of 5‑fluorouracil‑resistant colon cancer cells.,"5‑Fluorouracil (5‑FU) is a cytotoxic anticancer drug commonly used for patients with advanced colon cancer. This drug effectively reduces the size of tumors to a certain degree; however, cancer cells can gradually acquire resistance, resulting in disease progression. To identify the mechanism of 5‑FU resistance, we established three 5‑FU‑resistant colon cancer cell lines and analyzed both apoptosis‑related protein expression levels and BH3 profiling. These 5‑FU‑resistant colon cancer cell lines acquired apoptotic resistance to 5‑FU. Although apoptosis‑related protein expression levels were altered in each 5‑FU‑resistant colon cancer cell line variably, BH3 profiling indicated BCLXL dependence in 5‑FU‑resistant HT‑29 cells only. Functional BCLXL inhibition in 5‑FU‑resistant HT‑29 cells not only sensitized the cells to apoptosis but also overcame 5‑FU resistance. The apoptotic BIM protein was preferentially sequestered, thereby resulting in acquired dependence on BCLXL for survival. Additionally, in vivo models showed that BCLXL inhibition controlled tumor progression. These results indicate that BH3 profiling facilitates the identification of the functional role of anti‑apoptotic proteins during drug resistance and has clinical implications for colon cancer in targeting specific proteins such as BCLXL.",2019

31612394,Copy Number Aberrations of Multiple Genes Identified as Prognostic Markers for Extrahepatic Metastasis-free Survival of Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"Extrahepatic metastasis confers unfavorable patient prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however, reliable markers allowing prediction of extrahepatic metastasis at the time of initial diagnosis are still lacking. This study was to identify gene-level copy number aberrations (CNAs) related to extrahepatic metastasis-free survival of HCC patients, and further examine the associations between CNAs and gene expression. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and expression array were used to analyze gene CNAs and expression levels, respectively. The associations between CNAs of a panel of 20 genes and extrahepatic metastasis-free survival were analyzed in 66 patients with follow-up period of 1.6-90.5 months. The gene expression levels between HCCs with and without gene CNA were compared in 109 patients with HCC. We observed that gains at MDM4 and BCL2L1, and losses at APC and FBXW7 were independent prognostic markers for extrahepatic metastasis-free survival of HCC patients. Integration analysis of aCGH and expression data showed that MDM4 and BCL2L1 were significantly upregulated in HCCs with gene gain, while APC and FBXW7 were significantly downregulated in HCCs with gene loss. We concluded that gene gains at MDM4 and BCL2L1, and losses at APC and FBXW7, with concordant expression changes, were associated with extrahepatic metastasis-free survival of HCC patients and have potential to act as novel prognostic markers.",2019
31595832,PTPRT epigenetic silencing defines lung cancer with STAT3 activation and can direct STAT3 targeted therapies.,"Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription-3 (STAT3), a potent oncogenic transcription factor, is constitutively activated in lung cancer, but mutations in pathway genes are infrequent. Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor-T (PTPRT) is an endogenous inhibitor of STAT3 and PTPRT loss-of-function represents one potential mechanism of STAT3 hyperactivation as observed in other malignancies. We determined the role of PTPRT promoter methylation and sensitivity to STAT3 pathway inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). TCGA and Pittsburgh lung cancer cohort methylation data revealed hypermethylation of PTPRT associated with diminished mRNA expression in a subset of NSCLC patients. We report frequent hypermethylation of the PTPRT promoter which correlates with transcriptional silencing of PTPRT and increased STAT3 phosphorylation (Y705) as determined by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and real time quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR in NSCLC cell lines. Silencing of PTPRT using siRNA in H520 lung cancer cell line resulted in increased pSTAT3",2020
31587505,Quantifying the inhibitory effect of Bcl-xl on the action of Mff using live-cell fluorescence imaging.,"Mitochondrial fission regulates mitochondrial function and morphology, and has been linked to apoptosis. The mitochondrial fission factor (Mff), a tail-anchored membrane protein, induces excessive mitochondrial fission, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Here, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of Bcl-xl, an antiapoptotic protein, on the action of Mff by using live-cell fluorescence imaging. Microscopic imaging analysis showed that overexpression of Mff induced mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis, which were reversed by coexpression of Bcl-xl. Microscopic imaging and live-cell fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis demonstrated that Bcl-xl reconstructs the Mff network from punctate distribution of higher-order oligomers to filamentous distribution of lower-order oligomers. Live-cell fluorescence resonance energy transfer two-hybrid assay showed that Bcl-xl interacted with Mff to form heterogenous oligomers with 1 : 2 stoichiometry in cytoplasm and 1 : 1 stoichiometry on mitochondria, indicating that two Bcl-xl molecules primarily interact with four Mff molecules in cytoplasm, but with two Mff molecules on mitochondria.",2019
31566021,"Junduqing extractive promotes the apoptosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells through down-regulating Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL and up-regulating Caspase-3, Caspase-8 and Caspase-9.","This study aimed to investigate the effect of Junduqing extractive on proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells and the involved mechanism. Junduqing extractive was prepared. CCK-8 assay found that IC50 of Junduqing extractive in HNE-1 cells was 2.99 mg/ml, so its concentration of 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 mg/ml was selected to perform the following experiments. HNE-1, HNE-2 and HONE1 cells were then divided into four groups: (1) Control (no treatment); (2) 1.0 mg/ml (1.0 mg/ml Junduqing); (3) 2.0 mg/ml (2.0 mg/ml Junduqing) and (4) 3.0 mg/ml (3.0 mg/ml Junduqing). Cell viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion were examined by CCK-8 assay, annexin V-FITC/PI staining, scratch wound assay and transwell assay, respectively. Compared with the control group, the viability, migration rates and invasive capacity of HNE-1, HNE-2 and HONE1 cells with Junduqing treatments decreased significantly. Higher concentration of Junduqing extractive caused lower viability, smaller migration rates and weaker invasive capacity. Compared with the control group, the apoptosis of HNE-1, HNE-2 and HONE1 cells after treatment with 2.0 and 3.0 mg/ml of Junduqing extractive increased remarkably. Levels of Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, Caspase-3, Caspase-8 and Caspase-9 were examined by western blotting. Compared with the control group, the expression of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 and the expression of Caspase-3, Caspase-8 and Caspase-9 in HNE-1, HNE-2 and HONE1 cells were significantly down-regulated and up-regulated, respectively, after treatment with Junduqing extractive. In conclusion, Junduqing extractive could inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion, and promote the apoptosis of human NPC cells through down-regulating Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL and up-regulating Caspase-3, Caspase-8 and Caspase-9.",2019
31541080,The pharmalogical reactivation of p53 function improves breast tumor cell lysis by granzyme B and NK cells through induction of autophagy.,"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer cells (NK)-mediated elimination of tumor cells is mostly dependent on Granzyme B apoptotic pathway, which is regulated by the wild type (wt) p53 protein. Because TP53 inactivating mutations, frequently found in human tumors, could interfere with Granzyme B-mediated cell death, the use of small molecules developed to reactivate wtp53 function in p53-mutated tumor cells could optimize their lysis by CTL or NK cells. Here, we show that the pharmalogical reactivation of a wt-like p53 function in p53-mutated breast cancer cells using the small molecule CP-31398 increases their sensitivity to NK-mediated lysis. This potentiation is dependent on p53-mediated induction of autophagy via the sestrin-AMPK-mTOR pathway and the ULK axis. This CP31398-induced autophagy sequestrates in autophagosomes several anti-apoptotic proteins, including Bcl-X",2019

31525028,Predicting and Experimentally Validating Hot-Spot Residues at Protein-Protein Interfaces.,"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are vital to all biological processes. These interactions are often dynamic, sometimes transient, typically occur over large topographically shallow protein surfaces, and can exhibit a broad range of affinities. Considerable progress has been made in determining PPI structures. However, given the above properties, understanding the key determinants of their thermodynamic stability remains a challenge in chemical biology. An improved ability to identify and engineer PPIs would advance understanding of biological mechanisms and mutant phenotypes and also provide a firmer foundation for inhibitor design. ",2019

31492967,Stoichiometry and regulation network of Bcl-2 family complexes quantified by live-cell FRET assay.,"The stoichiometry and affinity of Bcl-2 family complexes are essential information for understanding how their interactome network is orchestrated to regulate mitochondrial permeabilization and apoptosis. Based on over-expression model system, FRET analysis was used to quantify the protein-protein interactions among Bax, Bcl-xL, Bad and tBid in healthy and apoptotic cells. Our data indicate that the stoichiometry and affinity of Bcl-2 complexes are dependent on their membrane environment. Bcl-xL, Bad and tBid can form hetero-trimers in mitochondria. Bcl-xL binds preferentially to Bad, then to tBid and Bax in mitochondria, whilst Bcl-xL displays higher affinity to Bad or tBid than to itself. Strikingly, Bax can bind to Bcl-xL in cytosol. In cytosol of apoptotic cells, Bcl-xL associates with Bax to form hetero-trimer with 1:2 stoichiometry, while Bcl-xL associates with Bad to form hetero-trimer with 2:1 stoichiometry and Bcl-xL associates with tBid to form hetero-dimer. In mitochondria, Bcl-xL associates with Bax/Bad to form hetero-dimer in healthy cells, while Bcl-xL associates with Bad to form hetero-tetramer with 3:1 stoichiometry in apoptotic cells.",2020

Decreased cancer cell lines viability was reported upon CA treatment. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism of CA induced cytotoxicity using two human cell lines, Jurkat E6.1 (human cell T lymphoma) and HL-60 (human acute promyelocytic leukemia). Significant increases of apoptotic cell death markers upon CA treatment were observed: annexin-V positiveness, potential mitochondrial disturbances, cell cycle changes, caspase activation, and CD95 expression. These effects were not detected in normal lymphocytes. CA induced the appearance of Bax, cleaved caspase 3, and cytochrome c release in Jurkat cells, and cleaved caspase 3 and phosphorylated p53 in HL60 cells. Likewise, downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-x (Jurkat), Bcl-2, and XIAP (HL60) was observed with CA treatment. Both pathways, intrinsic and extrinsic were activated when cell lines were treated with CA. NF-κB p65 inhibition was observed in Jurkat cells and cell differentiation in HL-60 cells. CA could be a potential leader compound for the development of new drugs for leukemia treatment in humans.",2019

We recently discovered that PTPσ is also expressed by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Here, we describe small molecule inhibitors of PTPσ that promote HSC regeneration in vivo. Systemic administration of the PTPσ inhibitor, DJ001, or its analog, to irradiated mice promotes HSC regeneration, accelerates hematologic recovery, and improves survival. Similarly, DJ001 administration accelerates hematologic recovery in mice treated with 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy. DJ001 displays high specificity for PTPσ and antagonizes PTPσ via unique non-competitive, allosteric binding. Mechanistically, DJ001 suppresses radiation-induced HSC apoptosis via activation of the RhoGTPase, RAC1, and induction of BCL-X",2019
31401087,Morpholide derivative of the novel oleanolic oxime and succinic acid conjugate diminish the expression and activity of NF-κB and STATs in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.,"Naturally occurring oleanolic acid (OA) possesses a hepatoprotective activity and ability to inhibit proliferation of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Both properties might be related to its anti-inflammatory activity. Its low bioavailability justifies the search for more hydrophilic OA derivatives. The aim of this study was the design and synthesis of four novel OA oxime derivatives conjugated with succinic acid at the C-3 position of oleanane skeleton structure and evaluation of their effect on NF-κB and STATs expression and activation in HepG2 cells. The expression of NF-κB and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), STAT5A/B and STAT3 with its target genes: BAX, BCL-XL and MYC was evaluated after 24 h treatment with tested compounds. The comparison of the levels of cytosolic and nuclear NF-κB subunits p50, p65 and STATs proteins was used as the measure of their activation. The results pointed out the 3-succinyloxyiminoolean-12-en-28-oic acid morpholide (SMAM) as the most potent modulator of NF-κB and STAT3. SMAM significantly reduced the expression and activation of NF-κB as well as its nuclear protein level of p65 subunit. This compound also reduced the expression and activation of STAT3 and STAT5A/B. Combined effect of SMAM on these transcription factors resulted in reduced expression of COX-2, MYC and anti-apoptotic BCL-XL genes. Simultaneously, the increased expression of pro-apoptotic BAX gene was observed. In the cells treated with 3-succinyloxyiminoolean-12-en-28-oic acid (SMAA) the increased expression of BAX was also found. The effects of 3-succinyloxyiminoolean-12-en-28-oic acid benzyl ester (SMAEB) and 3-succinyloxyiminoolean-12-en-28-oic acid methyl ester (SMAEM) were moderate and ambiguous in relation to the tested factors. Moreover, the coordinated action of SMAM on NF-κB and STAT3 confirms their close association in HepG2 cells. We conclude that SMAM efficiently downregulates the key elements of signaling pathways involved in inflammatory driven HCC. Thus, may be considered as a potential chemopreventive or therapeutic agent in this type of cancer.",2019
31387206,Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin Interferes with the Apoptosis of Human Skin Mast Cells by a Dual Strategy Involving STAT5/Mcl-1 and JNK/Bcl-x,"Mast cells (MCs) play critical roles in allergic and inflammatory reactions and contribute to multiple pathologies in the skin, in which they show increased numbers, which frequently correlates with severity. It remains ill-defined how MC accumulation is established by the cutaneous microenvironment, in part because research on human MCs rarely employs MCs matured in the tissue, and extrapolations from other MC subsets have limitations, considering the high level of MC heterogeneity. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)-released by epithelial cells, like keratinocytes, following disturbed homeostasis and inflammation-has attracted much attention, but its impact on skin MCs remains undefined, despite the vast expression of the TSLP receptor by these cells.

31329620,Cullin-4B E3 ubiquitin ligase mediates Apaf-1 ubiquitination to regulate caspase-9 activity.,"Apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) is a component of apoptosome, which regulates caspase-9 activity. In addition to apoptosis, Apaf-1 plays critical roles in the intra-S-phase checkpoint; therefore, impaired expression of Apaf-1 has been demonstrated in chemotherapy-resistant malignant melanoma and nuclear translocation of Apaf-1 has represented a favorable prognosis of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. In contrast, increased levels of Apaf-1 protein are observed in the brain in Huntington's disease. The regulation of Apaf-1 protein is not yet fully understood. In this study, we show that etoposide triggers the interaction of Apaf-1 with Cullin-4B, resulting in enhanced Apaf-1 ubiquitination. Ubiquitinated Apaf-1, which was degraded in healthy cells, binds p62 and forms aggregates in the cytosol. This complex of ubiquitinated Apaf-1 and p62 induces caspase-9 activation following MG132 treatment of HEK293T cells that stably express bcl-xl. These results show that ubiquitinated Apaf-1 may activate caspase-9 under conditions of proteasome impairment.",2019

The constitutive activation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) is evidenced as a pivotal driver of GBM pathogenesis and therapy resistance, and hence, is a promising GBM drug target. 5-acetyloxy-6,7,8,4'-tetramethoxyflavone (5-AcTMF) is an acetylated derivative of Tangeretin which is known to exert anticancer effects on breast, colon, lung, and multiple myeloma; however, its effect on GBM remains elusive. Herein, we reported that 5-AcTMF suppressed the viability and clonogenicity along with inducing apoptosis in multiple human GBM cell lines. Mechanistic analyses further revealed that 5-AcTMF lowered the levels of Tyrosine 705-phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3), a canonical marker of STAT3 activation, but also dampened p-STAT3 upregulation elicited by Interleukin-6. Notably, ectopic expression of dominant-active STAT3 impeded 5-AcTMF-induced suppression of viability and clonogenicity plus apoptosis induction in GBM cells, confirming the prerequisite of STAT3 blockage for the inhibitory action of 5-AcTMF on GBM cell survival and growth. Additionally, 5-AcTMF impaired the activation of STAT3 upstream kinase JAK2 but also downregulated antiapoptotic BCL-2 and BCL-xL in a STAT3-dependent manner. Moreover, the overexpression of either BCL-2 or BCL-xL abrogated 5-AcTMF-mediated viability reduction and apoptosis induction in GBM cells. Collectively, we, for the first time, revealed the anticancer effect of 5-AcTMF on GBM cells, which was executed via thwarting the JAK2-STAT3-BCL-2/BCL-xL signaling axis. Our findings further implicate the therapeutic potential of 5-AcTMF for GBM treatment.",2019

Most patients inevitably encounter drug resistance and resultant disease relapse. Reduced apoptosis plays a critical role in chemoresistance. Trifluoperazine (TFP), an antipsychotic agent, has demonstrated antitumor effects on various cancers. This study investigated the efficacy of TFP in inhibiting cisplatin-resistant bladder UC and explored the underlying mechanism. Our results revealed that cisplatin-resistant UC cells (T24/R) upregulated the antiapoptotic factor, B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL). Knockdown of Bcl-xL by siRNA resensitized cisplatin-resistant cells to the cisplatin cytotoxic effect. TFP (10-45 μM) alone elicited dose-dependent cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and G0/G1 arrest on T24/R cells. Co-treatment of TFP potentiated cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in T24/R cells. The phenomenon that TFP alleviated cisplatin resistance to T24/R was accompanied with concurrent suppression of Bcl-xL. In vivo models confirmed that TFP alone effectively suppressed the T24/R xenograft in nude mice. TFP co-treatment enhanced the antitumor effect of cisplatin on the T24/R xenograft. Our results demonstrated that TFP effectively inhibited cisplatin-resistant UCs and circumvented cisplatin resistance with concurrent Bcl-xL downregulation. These findings provide a promising insight to develop a therapeutic strategy for chemoresistant UCs.",2019
31243598,Aspirin induces oncosis in tumor cells.,"In contrast to the well-known anti-tumor mechanisms of aspirin in inducing apoptosis or autophagy, we here for the first time report oncosis induced by aspirin in tumor cells. In vitro and in vivo analysis showed that aspirin induced compromised Bcl-XL level and subsequent ATP depletion. Overexpression of CFP-Bcl-XL in Hela and A549 cells observably inhibited aspirin-induced ATP depletion and almost completely inhibited the aspirin-induced cells bubbling, while pharmacological inhibition of endogenous Bcl-XL activity by ABT-737 remarkably promoted aspirin-induced ATP depletion and cells bubbling, suggesting the key inhibitory role of Bcl-XL in aspirin-induced oncosis. Overexpression of Bax/Bad significantly promoted aspirin-induced oncosis. In addition, cells cultured in a glucose-free medium with low ATP level exhibited higher percentage of bubbling cells than the cells cultured in a glucose medium with high ATP level under aspirin treatment, indicating the important role of ATP depletion in aspirin-induced oncosis. Furthermore, caspase-3 was demonstrated to be not involved in aspirin-induced oncosis. Animal studies showed that aspirin treatment significantly inhibited tumors growth, but did not induce toxicities to mice. Collectively, aspirin inhibits tumors growth in mice and induces oncosis in which the compromised Bcl-XL and intracellular ATP depletion play a dominant role, which provides insights into the therapeutic strategy of aspirin in oncology.",2019
31240517,Fipronil induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in porcine oocytes during in vitro maturation.,"Fipronil (FPN) is a widely used phenylpyrazole pesticide that can kill pests by blocking γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-gated chloride channels. In addition, there are lack of studies on the effects of FPN on the female mammalian gametes. In this study, porcine oocytes were used to investigate the effects of FPN on the oocyte maturation process. The results showed that the first polar body extrusion rate significantly decreased (100 μM FPN vs. control, 18.64 ± 2.95% vs. 74.90 ± 1.50%, respectively), and oocytes were arrested at the germinal vesicle stage in 100 μM FPN group. Meanwhile, the FPN caused a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and severe DNA damage inside the oocytes. Furthermore, apoptosis was enhanced along with decreases in mitochondrial membrane potential, BCL-xL, and the release of cytochrome C in FPN-treated group. Additionally, low CDK1 activity and delayed cyclin B1 degradation during germinal vesicle breakdown were found in the FPN-treated group, which resulted from the activation of ATM-P53-P21 pathway. In conclusion, FPN induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in porcine oocyte maturation because of increased ROS levels and DNA damage. This suggests that the FPN in the environment may have potential detrimental effects on the female mammalian reproductive system.",2019

31178415,Gain of 20q11.21 in Human Pluripotent Stem Cells Impairs TGF-β-Dependent Neuroectodermal Commitment.,"Gain of 20q11.21 is one of the most common recurrent genomic aberrations in human pluripotent stem cells. Although it is known that overexpression of the antiapoptotic gene Bcl-xL confers a survival advantage to the abnormal cells, their differentiation capacity has not been fully investigated. RNA sequencing of mutant and control hESC lines, and a line transgenically overexpressing Bcl-xL, shows that overexpression of Bcl-xL is sufficient to cause most transcriptional changes induced by the gain of 20q11.21. Moreover, the differentially expressed genes in mutant and Bcl-xL overexpressing lines are enriched for genes involved in TGF-β- and SMAD-mediated signaling, and neuron differentiation. Finally, we show that this altered signaling has a dramatic negative effect on neuroectodermal differentiation, while the cells maintain their ability to differentiate to mesendoderm derivatives. These findings stress the importance of thorough genetic testing of the lines before their use in research or the clinic.",2019
31173228,Lipid storage droplet protein 5 reduces sodium palmitate‑induced lipotoxicity in human normal liver cells by regulating lipid metabolism‑related factors.,"Lipid storage droplet protein 5 (LSDP5) is specifically expressed in tissues with high oxidative metabolism such as liver and heart. The present study aimed to explored the role of LSDP5 in sodium palmitate‑induced lipotoxicity in LO2 normal human liver cells. LO2 cells were treated with various concentrations of sodium palmitate (25, 50, 75, 100, 125 and 150 µmol/l) for 12, 24 and 48 h, and cell viability was determined by Cell Counting Kit‑8. Subsequently, LO2 cells were exposed to 100 µmol/l sodium palmitate for 48 h to induce lipotoxicity (Model). Lipotoxicity Model LO2 cells were also transfected with pCMV5‑LSDP5 overexpression vector, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and apoptotic rates were measured. The contents of non‑esterified fatty acid (NEFA), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were also measured. The expression levels of LSDP5, and apoptosis‑, mitochondrial‑, lipid metabolism‑related factors were detected using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot assays. The results indicated that sodium palmitate exposure inhibited cell viability and induced lipotoxicity in LO2 cells. LSDP5 overexpression decreased ROS and apoptotic rates, and reduced NEFA and MDA content. LSDP5 transfection rescued the loss of MMP and elevated SOD content in lipotoxicity Model LO2 cells. In addition, LSDP5 upregulated the expression levels of B‑cell lymphoma‑2, acetyl‑CoA carboxylase1/2 and fatty acid synthase (Fas), whereas the expression levels of activated‑caspase‑3, Bcl‑2‑associated X protein, cytochrome c, cytochrome c oxidase subunits IV, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a and peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptors α levels were downregulated. LSDP5 may produce a protective effect on sodium palmitate‑induced lipotoxicity in LO2 cells by regulating lipid metabolism‑related factors.",2019
31150457,EGFR mutations and AKT phosphorylation are markers for sensitivity to combined MCL-1 and BCL-2/xL inhibition in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Lung cancer is among the common and deadly cancers. Although the treatment options for late-stage cancer patients have continued to increase in numbers, the overall survival rates for these patients have not shown significant improvement. This highlights the need for new targets and drugs to more effectively treat lung cancer patients. In this study, we characterize the MCL-1 inhibitor maritoclax alone or in combination with a BCL-2/xL inhibitor in a panel of lung cancer cell lines. BCL-2 family proteins, phosphorylated proteins, and apoptosis were monitored following the treatments. We found that maritoclax was effective at inhibiting growth in these lung cancer cells. We also establish that cell lines with EGFR mutations were most sensitive to the combined inhibition of MCL-1 and BCL-2/xL. In addition, a high level of phosphorylated AKT (S473) was identified as a marker for sensitivity to the combination treatment. This work has defined EGFR mutations and AKT phosphorylation as markers for sensitivity to combined MCL-1 and BCL-2/xL targeted therapy and establishes a rationale to explore multiple BCL-2 family members in patients who are refractory to EGFR inhibitor treatment. Our data support the design of a clinical trial that aims to employ inhibitors of the BCL-2 family of proteins in lung cancer patients.",2019

31098993,siRNA-Based Drug Targeting Human Bcl-xL Against Cancers.,"The 2006 discovery of the process of RNA interference opened the door to application of this phenomenon for disease treatments. Short interfering RNA (siRNA) can be used to induce RNA interference, and this approach has generated much interest as a new type of nucleic acid-based drugs in humans and other mammals. However, despite the great potential of siRNA-based drugs in cancer therapy, some drawbacks of siRNAs, such as their instability in vivo and poor cellular uptake, remain unresolved. Here, we review the development of siRNA-based drugs targeting the human Bcl-xL gene, an anti-apoptotic factor overexpressed in many cancers, including prostate cancers. We also introduce a novel application of the biomaterial atelocollagen as a vehicle to functionally deliver tumor-specific siRNA molecules in nude mice. Here, we introduce an orthotopic tumor inoculation model in nude mice: the resulting orthotopic tumors more closely replicate the clinical conditions in humans-including the metastasis mode-than ectopic subcutaneously inoculated tumors.",2019
31078151,A hesperetin derivative plays a role in immunoregulatory effect on human macrophages.,"The immune system is an important physiological defense system. Its balance and stability are closely related to the body's health. Once the immune system loses its dynamic balance, the immune response will be blocked, which will lead to the occurrence of various diseases. Hesperetin is a kind of natural flavonoids extracted from citrus fruits of Rutaceae and it has many pharmacological activities. However, its water solubility and liposolubility are poor, and it is easy to be quickly metabolized in vivo, so it is difficult to maintain high blood drug concentration. Therefore, its derivative (HES) was found by structural modification. In this study, THP-1 cells were used as experimental model to investigate the immunomodulatory effect of HES in vitro. The results showed that HES participates in immune response by enhancing phagocytosis of macrophages to promote the release of NO, IL-6 and IL-1β, and enhancing immunity by up-regulating the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL proteins. This study provides a theoretical and practical basis for the development of HES as an immunomodulator in the future.",2019

Simultaneously, anti-apoptotic proteins (p21WAF-1, MDM2, Bcl-x, Mcl-1, MKP1, MAKAPK2, ERK5, APP, calmodulin, estrogen receptor) were overexpressed. Some proteins associated with actin cytoskeleton (α-catenin, catenin p120CTN, cofilin, p35, myosin Vα) were upregulated, whereas other actin-associated proteins (ezrin, distrophin, tropomyosin, spectrin (α + β), phosphorylated Pyk2) were downregulated.

31059068,Overexpression of COX6B1 protects against I/R‑induced neuronal injury in rat hippocampal neurons.,"Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. The role of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6B1 (COX6B1) in the central nervous system remains unclear. The present study aimed to analyze the role of COX6B1 in rat hippocampal neurons extracted from fetal rats. The subcellular localization of the neuron‑specific marker microtubule‑associated protein 2 was detected by immunofluorescence assay. Cell viability was assessed using a cell counting kit, and the levels of apoptosis and cytosolic Ca2+ were analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression levels of the molecular factors downstream to COX6B1 were determined using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Reoxygenation following oxygen‑glucose deprivation (OGD) decreased cell viability and the expression levels of COX6B1 in a time‑dependent manner, and 60 min of reoxygenation was identified as the optimal time period for establishing an ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) model. Overexpression of COX6B1 was demonstrated to reverse the viability of hippocampal neurons following I/R treatment. Specifically, COX6B1 overexpression decreased the cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ and suppressed neuronal apoptosis, which were increased following I/R treatment. Furthermore, overexpression of COX6B1 increased the protein expression levels of apoptosis regulator BCL‑2 and mitochondrial cytochrome c (cyt c), and decreased the protein expression levels of apoptosis regulator BCL2‑associated X and cytosolic cyt c in I/R model cells. Collectively, the present study results suggested that COX6B1 overexpression may reverse I/R‑induced neuronal damage by increasing the viability of neurons, by decreasing the cytosolic levels of Ca2+ and by suppressing apoptosis. These results may facilitate the development of novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of CVD.",2019
31032366,High-Dose Aspirin Reverses Tartrazine-Induced Cell Growth Dysregulation Independent of p53 Signaling and Antioxidant Mechanisms in Rat Brain.,"Tartrazine, an azo dye used in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals with the effects on cell cycle, is not well understood. Therefore, we investigated the toxicity of tartrazine in rat brain with high-dose aspirin. Male Wistar rats (n = 24) were divided into (C) control, (T) tartrazine (700 mg/kg body weight [BW] at weeks 1 and 2), (A) aspirin (150 mg/kg [BW] at weeks 1, 2, and 3), and (TA) aspirin + tartrazine (150 mg/kg [BW] aspirin at weeks 1, 2, and 3 and 700 mg/kg [BW] tartrazine at weeks 1 and 2) groups. The expression of p53, B cell lymphoma-2 extra-large (Bcl-xL), cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), p27, and Ki67 was evaluated by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. A histopathological analysis of brain tissue and oxidative stress level was assessed based on reduced glutathione (GSH), ascorbic acid (AA), and malondialdehyde levels. We found that Bcl-xL, Ki67, CDK2, and p27 were upregulated and p53 was downregulated in the tartrazine-treated group as compared to the control group. Aspirin administration reversed these changes except P53 expression. Tartrazine had no effect on lipid peroxidation but altered AA and GSH levels with no reversal by aspirin treatment. Histopathological analysis revealed that aspirin prevented tartrazine-induced damage including increased perivascular space and hemorrhage. These results indicate that aspirin protects the brain from tartrazine-induced toxicity independent of p53 signaling and antioxidant mechanisms.",2019

31004798,Lipid-modulation of membrane insertion and refolding of the apoptotic inhibitor Bcl-xL.,"Bcl-xL is a member of the Bcl-2 family of apoptotic regulators, responsible for inhibiting the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane, and a promising anti-cancer target. Bcl-xL exists in the following conformations, each believed to play a role in the inhibition of apoptosis: (a) a soluble folded conformation, (b) a membrane-anchored (by its C-terminal α8 helix) form, which retains the same fold as in solution and (c) refolded membrane-inserted conformations, for which no structural data are available. Previous studies established that in the cell Bcl-xL exists in a dynamic equilibrium between soluble and membranous states, however, no direct evidence exists in support of either anchored or inserted conformation of the membranous state in vivo. In this in vitro study, we employed a combination of fluorescence and EPR spectroscopy to characterize structural features of the bilayer-inserted conformation of Bcl-xL and the lipid modulation of its membrane insertion transition. Our results indicate that the core hydrophobic helix α6 inserts into the bilayer without adopting a transmembrane orientation. This insertion disrupts the packing of Bcl-xL and releases the regulatory N-terminal BH4 domain (α1) from the rest of the protein structure. Our data demonstrate that both insertion and refolding of Bcl-xL are modulated by lipid composition, which brings the apparent pK",2019

30982888,Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 regulates muscle fiber development in cooperation with related genes to affect meat quality.,"Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is an important signal protein that is widely involved in physiological processes, such as lipid metabolism, cell movement, and disease processes. However, the relationship between LRP1 and meat quality remains unknown in chickens. The present study aimed to investigate the correlation between LRP1 and meat quality that builds on our preliminary research, as well as to reveal the underlying molecular mechanism of LRP1 on meat-quality traits. The results showed that LRP1 was significantly correlated with shear force (P < 0.05). Several key genes involved in muscle growth and development, including IGF-1, IGFBP-5, IGF-1R, IGF-2, and MyoD, were down-regulated significantly (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), and MSTN was up-regulated significantly (P < 0.01) in the presence of LRP1 interference. Cell proliferation- or apoptosis-related genes, including PMP22, CDKN2C, and p53, increased significantly (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), whereas Bcl-x decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in the RNAi group. We conclude that LRP1 regulates muscle fiber development in cooperation with related genes that affect myoblast proliferation and apoptosis, thereby impacting shear force in chickens. This study will provide a valuable resource for biological investigations of muscle growth and meat-quality-related genes in chickens. The results could be useful in identifying candidate genes that could be used for selective breeding to improve meat quality.",2019
30972067,Establishment of Systems to Enable Isolation of Porcine Monoclonal Antibodies Broadly Neutralizing the Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus.,"The rapid evolution of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome viruses (PRRSV) poses a major challenge to effective disease control since available vaccines show variable efficacy against divergent strains. Knowledge of the antigenic targets of virus-neutralizing antibodies that confer protection against heterologous PRRSV strains would be a catalyst for the development of next-generation vaccines. Key to discovering these epitopes is the isolation of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from immune pigs. To address this need, we sought to establish systems to enable the isolation of PRRSV neutralizing porcine mAbs. We experimentally produced a cohort of immune pigs by sequential challenge infection with four heterologous PRRSV strains spanning PRRSV-1 subtypes and PRRSV species. Whilst priming with PRRSV-1 subtype 1 did not confer full protection against a subsequent infection with a PRRSV-1 subtype 3 strain, animals were protected against a subsequent PRRSV-2 infection. The infection protocol resulted in high serum neutralizing antibody titers against PRRSV-1 Olot/91 and significant neutralization of heterologous PRRSV-1/-2 strains. Enriched memory B cells isolated at the termination of the study were genetically programmed by transduction with a retroviral vector expressing the Bcl-6 transcription factor and the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL protein, a technology we demonstrated efficiently converts porcine memory B cells into proliferating antibody-secreting cells. Pools of transduced memory B cells were cultured and supernatants containing PRRSV-specific antibodies identified by flow cytometric staining of infected MARC-145 cells and ",2019
30955242,LukS-PV induces apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia cells mediated by C5a receptor.,"LukS-PV is one of the two components of Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL). Our previous study showed that LukS-PV can induce apoptosis in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) THP-1 and HL-60 cells. C5aR (C5a receptor) is the receptor for PVL, but whether C5aR plays a key role in LukS-PV induced apoptosis is unclear. The aim of this study was to establish whether C5aR plays a physiological role in apoptosis of leukemia cells induced by LukS-PV. We investigated the role of C5aR in leukemia cell apoptosis induced by LukS-PV by pretreatment of THP-1 and HL-60 cells with C5aR antagonist and transfection to knockdown C5aR in THP-1 cells or overexpress C5aR in Jurkat cells before treatment with LukS-PV. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by staining with Annexin V/propidium iodide or Annexin V-PE/7-AAD. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was determined using JC-1 dye. The expression of apoptosis-associated genes and proteins was identified by qRT-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analysis, respectively. As the C5aR antagonist concentration increased, the rate of apoptosis induced by LukS-PV decreased, the MMP increased, and expression of pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak genes and proteins was downregulated while that of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-x genes and proteins was upregulated. Knockdown of C5aR also decreased LukS-PV-induced THP-1 cell apoptosis. LukS-PV did not induce apoptosis of Jurkat cells, which have no endogenous C5aR expression; however, LukS-PV did induce apoptosis in Jurkat cells after overexpression of C5aR. Correspondingly, the MMP decreased and Bax and Bak were upregulated while Bcl-2 and Bcl-x were downregulated. LukS-PV can induce apoptosis in AML cells by targeting C5aR. C5aR may be a potential therapeutic target for AML and LukS-PV is a candidate targeted drug for the treatment of AML.",2019

30931932,Anoikis resistant mediated by FASN promoted growth and metastasis of osteosarcoma.,"The pulmonary metastasis of osteosarcoma (OS) occurs commonly, which resulted from anoikis resistant (AR) of tumor cells as reported by previous studies, but the exact roles of AR in osteosarcoma were not fully studied. Our previous investigations showed fatty acid synthase (FASN) was relating to clinical features of patients with OS. In this study, we aim to explore the functions of FASN in the AR OS cells in vitro and in vivo and study the downstream effectors of FASN. In the present study, we used our established cell model to study the AR. We revealed that AR promoted cell proliferation and migration as determined by colony formation assay and transwell assay. In addition, AR assisted tumor growth in vivo. In the AR cells, the expression of FASN was higher. Thus, we constructed lentiviruses to silence or overexpress FASN in four cell lines to study functions of FASN. Silence of FASN reduced cell colonies and migration while overexpression of FASN increased colonies and migration in suspended cells. Loss of functions of FASN induced cell apoptosis in suspended OS cells while gain of function of FASN suppressed apoptosis as determined by flow cytometry. We found the levels of p-ERK1/2 and Bcl-xL declined when FASN was silenced while they increased when FASN was overexpressed. In addition, results showed that the levels of FASN and its potential related molecules (p-ERK1/2 and Bcl-xL) increased in 143B-AR and MG-63-AR cells. In vivo study showed that inhibition of FASN decreased pulmonary metastasis of OS. In conclusion, we showed that anoikis resistant and FASN as two interactional factors facilitated the progress of osteosarcoma.",2019

30894073,Loss of MIEF1/MiD51 confers susceptibility to BAX-mediated cell death and PINK1-PRKN-dependent mitophagy.,"Mitochondrial dynamics is highly implicated in a plethora of cellular processes including apoptosis and mitophagy. However, little is known about the scope and precise functions of mitochondrial dynamics proteins for mitochondrial quality control and cellular homeostasis. Whether mitochondrial dynamics proteins serve in cellular processes reliant on mitochondrial fission-fusion is still not fully explored. MIEF1/MiD51 (mitochondrial elongation factor 1) is known to promote mitochondrial fission via the recruitment of GTPase protein DNM1L/DRP1 (dynamin 1 like), but the fundamental understandings of MIEF1 for mitochondrial-dependent cellular processes are largely elusive. Here, we report novel roles of MIEF1 in responding to apoptotic stimuli and mitochondrial damage. Given our result that staurosporine (STS) treatment induced the degradation of MIEF1 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), we are motivated to explore the role of MIEF1 in apoptosis. MIEF1 loss triggered the imbalance of BCL2 family members on the mitochondria, consequently initiating the translocation of BAX onto the mitochondria, catalyzing the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and promoting the release of DIABLO/SMAC (diablo IAP-binding mitochondrial protein) and CYCS (cytochrome c, somatic). We further demonstrate that MIEF1 deficiency impaired mitochondrial respiration and induced mitochondrial oxidative stress, sensitizing cells to PINK1-PRKN-mediated mitophagy. The recruitment of PRKN to depolarized mitochondria modulated the UPS-dependent degradation of MFN2 (mitofusin 2) and FIS1 (fission, mitochondrial 1) specifically, to further promote mitophagy. Our findings uncover a bridging role of MIEF1 integrating cell death and mitophagy, unlikely dependent on mitochondrial dynamics, implying new insights to mechanisms determining cellular fate.",2019
30874970,Secretin Prevents Apoptosis in the Developing Cerebellum Through Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL.,"Secretin (SCT) is involved in a variety of physiological processes and has been implicated in preventing apoptosis during brain development. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying its neuroprotective effects. The B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, determine the commitment of neurons to apoptosis. In SCT knockout mice, we found reduced transcript levels of anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, but not of pro-apoptotic gene Bax, in the developing cerebellum. SCT treatment on ex vivo cultured cerebellar slices triggered a time-dependent increase of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression. This SCT-induced transcriptional regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL was dependent on the cyclic AMP (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB), which is a key survival factor at the convergence of multiple signaling cascades. We further demonstrated that activation of CREB by SCT was mediated by cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) cascades. These findings, collectively, provide an uncharacterized signaling cascade for SCT-mediated neuronal survival, in which SCT promotes the key anti-apoptotic elements Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in the intrinsic death pathway through PKA- and ERK-regulated CREB phosphorylation.",2019
30859392,Combined inhibition of RAC1 and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL synergistically induces glioblastoma cell death through down-regulation of the Usp9X/Mcl-1 axis.,"Anti-apoptotic and pro-migratory phenotypes are hallmarks of neoplastic diseases, including primary brain malignancies. In this work, we examined whether reprogramming of the apoptotic and migratory machineries through a multi-targeting approach would induce enhanced cell death and enhanced inhibition of the migratory capacity of glioblastoma cells.",2019

30841431,"Novel protective effect of O-1602 and abnormal cannabidiol, GPR55 agonists, on ER stress-induced apoptosis in pancreatic β-cells.","Insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction are the main defects in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), and β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis is the critical determinant in the progression of T2DM. G-protein coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) is an orphan G-protein coupled receptor, which is activated by endocannabinoids and lipid transmitters. Recently, GPR55 was shown to regulate glucose and energy homeostasis, however its role in β-cell apoptosis was not studied. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the novel effect of GPR55 agonists, O-1602 and abnormal cannabidiol (Abn-CBD), on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis in mouse pancreatic β-cell lines, MIN6 and Beta-TC-6, and its underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that O-1602 and Abn-CBD reduced ER stress-induced apoptosis in MIN6 and Beta-TC-6 cells. This was through the phosphorylation of 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB) in β-cells, hence activating CREB downstream anti-apoptotic genes, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Moreover, O-1602 and Abn-CBD directly activated kinases, CaMKIV, Erk1/2 and PKA, to induce CREB phosphorylation. Therefore, our results indicated that GPR55 agonists protected from β-cell apoptosis through CREB activation, thus up-regulating anti-apoptotic genes. In conclusion, our study provided a novel protective effect of GPR55 agonists on ER stress-induced apoptosis in β-cells and its underlying mechanisms mediating this protection, therefore we suggested that GPR55 might be a therapeutic target for T2DM.",2019
30840537,Retromer facilitates the localization of Bcl-xL to the mitochondrial outer membrane.,"The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bcl-xL plays a critical role in cell survival by protecting the integrity of the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). The mechanism through which Bcl-xL is recruited to the MOM has not been fully discerned. The retromer is a conserved endosomal scaffold complex involved in membrane trafficking. Here we identify VPS35 and VPS26, two core components of the retromer, as novel regulators of Bcl-xL. We observed interactions and colocalization between Bcl-xL, VPS35, VPS26, and MICAL-L1, a protein involved in recycling endosome biogenesis that also interacts with the retromer. We also found that upon VPS35 depletion, levels of nonmitochondrial Bcl-xL were increased. In addition, retromer-depleted cells displayed more rapid Bax activation and apoptosis. These results suggest that the retromer regulates apoptosis by facilitating Bcl-xL's transport to the MOM. Importantly, our studies suggest a previously uncharacterized relationship between the machineries of cell death/survival and endosomal trafficking.",2019
30797877,Upregulated cyclin B1/CDK1 mediates apoptosis following 2-methoxyestradiol-induced mitotic catastrophe: Role of Bcl-X,"2-Methoxyestradiol is an endogenous nonpolar metabolite of 17β-estradiol with a strong antitubulin activity. Earlier we showed that 2-methoxyestradiol increases the level and activity of cyclin B1/CDK1, which subsequently induces mitotic prometaphase arrest. In the present study, we demonstrate that upregulation of cyclin B1/CDK1 is responsible for the increased phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-X",2019
30792387,BCL-2 family isoforms in apoptosis and cancer.,"The BCl-2 family has long been identified for its role in apoptosis. Following the initial discovery of BCL-2 in the context of B-cell lymphoma in the 1980s, a number of homologous proteins have since been identified. The members of the Bcl-2 family are designated as such due to their BCL-2 homology (BH) domains and involvement in apoptosis regulation. The BH domains facilitate the family members' interactions with each other and can indicate pro- or anti-apoptotic function. Traditionally, these proteins are categorised into one of the three subfamilies; anti-apoptotic, BH3-only (pro-apoptotic), and pore-forming or 'executioner' (pro-apoptotic) proteins. Each of the BH3-only or anti-apoptotic proteins has a distinct pattern of activation, localisation and response to cell death or survival stimuli. All of these can vary across cell or stress types, or developmental stage, and this can cause the delineation of the roles of BCL-2 family members. Added to this complexity is the presence of relatively uncharacterised isoforms of many of the BCL-2 family members. There is a gap in our knowledge regarding the function of BCL-2 family isoforms. BH domain status is not always predictive or indicative of protein function, and several other important sequences, which can contribute to apoptotic activity have been identified. While therapeutic strategies targeting the BCL-2 family are constantly under development, it is imperative that we understand the molecules, which we are attempting to target. This review, discusses our current knowledge of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family isoforms. With significant improvements in the potential for splicing therapies, it is important that we begin to understand the distinctions of the BCL-2 family, not limited to just the mechanisms of apoptosis control, but in their roles outside of apoptosis.",2019
30773485,Anti-apoptotic Mutations Desensitize Human Pluripotent Stem Cells to Mitotic Stress and Enable Aneuploid Cell Survival.,"Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are susceptible to numerical and structural chromosomal alterations during long-term culture. We show that mitotic errors occur frequently in hPSCs and that prometaphase arrest leads to very rapid apoptosis in undifferentiated but not in differentiated cells. hPSCs express high levels of proapoptotic protein NOXA in undifferentiated state. Knocking out NOXA by CRISPR or upregulation of the anti-apoptosis gene BCL-XL significantly reduced mitotic cell death, allowing the survival of aneuploid cells and the formation of teratomas significantly larger than their wild-type parental hPSCs. These results indicate that the normally low threshold of apoptosis in hPSCs can safeguard their genome integrity by clearing cells undergoing abnormal division. The amplification of BCL2L1 on chromosome 20q11.21, a frequent mutation in hPSCs, although not directly oncogenic, reduces the sensitivity of hPSCs to damage caused by erroneous mitosis and increases the risk of gaining aneuploidy.",2019

30712788,"Mycoplasma bovis delay in apoptosis of macrophages is accompanied by increased expression of anti-apoptotic genes, reduced cytochrome C translocation and inhibition of DNA fragmentation.","Bacterial pathogens have evolved to manipulate host cell death and survival pathways for their intracellular persistence. Understanding the ability of a bacterium to induce or inhibit cell death is essential for elucidating the disease pathogenesis and suggesting potential therapeutic options to manage the infection. In recent years, apoptosis inhibition by different bacteria has been suggested as a mechanism of survival by allowing the pathogen to replicate and disseminate in the host. Mycoplasma bovis has evolved mechanisms to invade and modulate apoptosis of bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), red blood cells (RBCs), primary macrophages and monocytes. To date, these mechanisms are poorly understood. Using apoptosis assays such as Annexin V binding, caspases activity, reactive oxygen species production, DNA fragmentation and differential gene expression we set out to determine how M. bovis modulates macrophage survival. Using the BoMac cell line, we report a significant reduction in STS-induced apoptosis through caspase dependent manner. Besides activating the NF-kβ pathway and inhibiting caspases 3, 6 and 9, M. bovis strain Mb1 also inhibits production of reactive oxygen species and DNA fragmentation of the host cell. We also report a significant up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-2 and Bcl-X",2019
30700020,Characterizing Cellular Responses During Oncolytic Maraba Virus Infection.,"The rising demand for powerful oncolytic virotherapy agents has led to the identification of Maraba virus, one of the most potent oncolytic viruses from Rhabdoviridae family which displays high selectivity for killing malignant cells and low cytotoxicity in normal cells. Although the virus is readied to be used for clinical trials, the interactions between the virus and the host cells is still unclear. Using a newly developed interferon-sensitive mutant Maraba virus (MG1), we have identified two key regulators of global translation (4E-BP1 and eIF2α) as being involved in the regulation of protein synthesis in the infected cells. Despite the translational arrest upon viral stress, we showed an up-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL protein that provides a survival benefit for the host cell, yet facilitates effective viral propagation. Given the fact that eIF5B canonically regulates 60S ribosome subunit end joining and is able to replace the role of eIF2 in delivering initiator tRNA to the 40S ribosome subunit upon the phosphorylation of eIF2α we have tested whether eIF5B mediates the translation of target mRNAs during MG1 infection. Our results show that the inhibition of eIF5B significantly down-regulates the level of ",2019
30683842,Cereblon attenuates DNA damage-induced apoptosis by regulating the transcription-independent function of p53.,"Cereblon (CRBN) is the substrate receptor of the cullin 4-RING E3 ligase complex and has been employed for targeted protein degradation in the treatment of cancers. However, its normal physiological functions and molecular mechanism in the regulation of DNA damage response are largely unknown. Here we find that CRBN plays a protective role against DNA damage-induced apoptosis in cell lines and primary cells. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that although CRBN does not affect the ubiquitination and degradation of the tumor suppressor p53, it directly interacts with p53 and therefore, suppresses the interaction between p53 and anti-apoptotic regulators Bcl-2 and Bcl-X",2019
30679390,Combined MEK and BCL-2/X,"Most patients with late-stage high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) initially respond to chemotherapy but inevitably relapse and develop resistance, highlighting the need for novel therapies to improve patient outcomes. The MEK/ERK pathway is activated in a large subset of HGSOC, making it an attractive therapeutic target. Here, we systematically evaluated the extent of MEK/ERK pathway activation and efficacy of pathway inhibition in a large panel of well-annotated HGSOC patient-derived xenograft models. The vast majority of models were nonresponsive to the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib (GDC-0973) despite effective pathway inhibition. Proteomic analyses of adaptive responses to GDC-0973 revealed that GDC-0973 upregulated the proapoptotic protein BIM, thus priming the cells for apoptosis regulated by BCL2-family proteins. Indeed, combination of both MEK inhibitor and dual BCL-2/X",2019
30671754,miR-214 is Stretch-Sensitive in Aortic Valve and Inhibits Aortic Valve Calcification.,"miR-214 has been recently found to be significantly downregulated in calcified human aortic valves (AVs). ER stress, especially the ATF4-mediated pathway, has also been shown to be significantly upregulated in calcific AV disease. Since elevated cyclic stretch is one of the major mechanical stimuli for AV calcification and ATF4 is a validated target of miR-214, we investigated the effect of cyclic stretch on miR-214 expression as well as those of ATF4 and two downstream genes (CHOP and BCL2L1). Porcine aortic valve (PAV) leaflets were cyclically stretched at 15% for 48 h in regular medium and for 1 week in osteogenic medium to simulate the early remodeling and late calcification stages of stretch-induced AV disease, respectively. For both stages, 10% cyclic stretch served as the physiological counterpart. RT-qPCR revealed that miR-214 expression was significantly downregulated during the late calcification stage, whereas the mRNA expression of ATF4 and BCL2L1 was upregulated and downregulated, respectively, during both early remodeling and late calcification stages. When PAV leaflets were statically transfected with miR-214 mimic in osteogenic medium for 2 weeks, calcification was significantly reduced compared to the control mimic case. This implies that miR-214 may have a protective role in stretch-induced calcific AV disease.",2019
30659540,Homology Modeling and Docking Studies of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL with Small Molecule Inhibitors: Identification and Functional Studies.,"Apoptosis is a vital physiological process, which is observed in various biological events. The anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic members of Bcl-2 family are the most characterized proteins which are involved in the regulation of apoptotic cell death. The anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL prevent apoptosis, whereas pro-apoptotic members like Bax and Bak, elicit the release of caspases from death antagonists inducing apoptosis. Thus, the Bcl-2 family of proteins play a vital role in controlling programmed cell death. Over expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are often directly associated with various kinds of cancer. Developing suitable inhibitors for controlling the elevated levels of these proteins got much attention in last decade. Structural biology techniques such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, homology modeling and molecular docking play a significant role in identifying the key inhibitors of these proteins. The authors have developed and tested successfully, several series of indole pharmacore containing inhibitors for Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins based on the homology modeling, docking and suitable biochemical and apoptosis assays. This review provides a summary of potential inhibitor molecules developed for Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins, as well as the the key residues of these proteins interacting with potential drug molecules. The present appraisal also focuses on the role of computational algorithms in developing potential drug molecules,with more emphasis on the role of homology modeling and docking studies in developing inhibitors for Bcl- 2, and Bcl-xL proteins in cancer therapy.",2018

30635584,Sensitivity to splicing modulation of BCL2 family genes defines cancer therapeutic strategies for splicing modulators.,"Dysregulation of RNA splicing by spliceosome mutations or in cancer genes is increasingly recognized as a hallmark of cancer. Small molecule splicing modulators have been introduced into clinical trials to treat solid tumors or leukemia bearing recurrent spliceosome mutations. Nevertheless, further investigation of the molecular mechanisms that may enlighten therapeutic strategies for splicing modulators is highly desired. Here, using unbiased functional approaches, we report that the sensitivity to splicing modulation of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 family genes is a key mechanism underlying preferential cytotoxicity induced by the SF3b-targeting splicing modulator E7107. While BCL2A1, BCL2L2 and MCL1 are prone to splicing perturbation, BCL2L1 exhibits resistance to E7107-induced splicing modulation. Consequently, E7107 selectively induces apoptosis in BCL2A1-dependent melanoma cells and MCL1-dependent NSCLC cells. Furthermore, combination of BCLxL (BCL2L1-encoded) inhibitors and E7107 remarkably enhances cytotoxicity in cancer cells. These findings inform mechanism-based approaches to the future clinical development of splicing modulators in cancer treatment.",2019

Antagonists of BCL-2 family proteins include BCL-2-selective inhibitor ABT-199, MCL-1-selective inhibitor A-1210477, BCL-xL-selective inhibitor A-1155463. In this study, we evaluated their potential inhibitory effectiveness. Our data showed that OCI-AML3 cells and U937 cells were resistant to BCL-2-selective inhibitor ABT-199 ",2019

30603953,IL-22 in hepatocyte's survival of Pakistani patients with end stage liver disease: an insight into IL 22 mediated hepato-regenerative pathway.,"Hepatitis is the principal cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and decompensated cirrhosis. HCC is amongst the leading causes of deaths worldwide. Current therapeutic options have proven to be unsuccessful in treating this disease due to multifactorial nature of the disease. The present study was designed to investigate the role of IL-22 mediated survival of hepatocytes during cirrhosis and HCC. Resected/explanted liver tissue samples of patients with End Stage Liver Disease were obtained from Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Liver Transplant Unit of Sheikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan. Qualitative expression of IL-22, SOCS3, and IL-22 induced anti-apoptotic protein, B-cell lymphoma extra-large (Bcl-xL), were evaluated by Immunohistochemical analysis (IHC). The IHC analysis revealed significantly high expression of IL-22, SOCS3, and Bcl-xL within explanted livers of HCC patients. Overall, the expression of SOCS3 was higher than any other protein, and the expression of all proteins showed significant variation in different group of patients based on clincopathological features. The results of the current study indicated that IL-22 mediated JAK-STAT pathway i.e. liver regeneration and healing is dependent on the disease progression and type of agent responsible for causing the infection in the first place.

The current research was done to evaluate the implement of stattic, specific STAT3 inhibitor on the anti-proliferative and apoptotic behavior of doxorubicin on ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells. Cell viability was investigated by MTT assay, the percentage of apoptosis by DAPI staining, and Annexin V.

30537511,BH3-Mimetic Drugs: Blazing the Trail for New Cancer Medicines.,"Defects in apoptotic cell death can promote cancer and impair responses of malignant cells to anti-cancer therapy. Pro-survival BCL-2 proteins prevent apoptosis by keeping the cell death effectors, BAX and BAK, in check. The BH3-only proteins initiate apoptosis by neutralizing the pro-survival BCL-2 proteins. Structural analysis and medicinal chemistry led to the development of small-molecule drugs that mimic the function of the BH3-only proteins to kill cancer cells. The BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax has been approved for treatment of refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia and this drug and inhibitors of pro-survival MCL-1 and BCL-XL are being tested in diverse malignancies.",2018
30536015,Isolation of Synthetic Antibodies Against BCL-2-Associated X Protein (BAX).,"The BCL-2 protein family plays central roles in the mitochondrial pathway of cell apoptosis. The BCL-2-Associated X protein (BAX), along with other proapoptotic proteins, induces cell death in response to a variety of stress stimuli. Upon receipt of killing signals, cytosolic BAX is activated and translocates to mitochondria where it causes mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and initials a series of cellular events that eventually lead to cell destruction. Despite recent progress toward understanding the structure, function, and activation mechanism of BAX, detailed information about how cytosolic BAX can be inhibited is still limited. Here we describe a method of selecting synthetic antibody fragments (Fabs) against BAX using phage display. Synthetic antibodies discovered from the selection have been used as structural probes to gain novel mechanistic details on BAX inhibition. This synthetic antibody selection method could be potentially applied to other BCL-2 proteins.",2019

30535997,Application of Mito-Priming to Generate BCL-2 Addicted Cells.,"The majority of apoptotic stimuli trigger cell death through the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Invariably, mitochondrial apoptosis requires engagement of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization or MOMP to initiate cell death. We have developed a new method, called mito-priming, that allows for rapid and synchronous induction of mitochondrial apoptosis in an on-target manner. Mito-priming uses coexpression of pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins to render cells sensitive to the addition of Bcl-2 targeting BH3-mimetic drugs. This chapter describes how to design mito-priming constructs and apply them to generate mito-primed lines. Second, we describe how to validate cell death sensitivity of mito-primed lines using different methods. Finally, we describe how to generate MOMP-resistant cell lines, using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletion of BAX and BAK. Facilitating the investigation of mitochondrial apoptosis, mito-priming provides a clean, robust way to induce mitochondrial apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo.",2019
30529602,Breathing hydrogen sulfide prevents delayed paraplegia in mice.,"Delayed paraplegia complicates the recovery from spinal cord ischemia or traumatic spinal cord injury. While delayed motor neuron apoptosis is implicated in the pathogenesis, no effective treatment or preventive measures is available for delayed paraplegia. Hydrogen sulfide exerts anti-apoptotic effects. Here, we examined effects of hydrogen sulfide breathing on the recovery from transient spinal cord ischemia. Breathing hydrogen sulfide starting 23 h after reperfusion for 5 h prevented delayed paraplegia after 5 min of spinal cord ischemia. Beneficial effects of hydrogen sulfide were mediated by upregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL and abolished by nitric oxide synthase 2 deficiency. S-nitrosylation of NFkB p65 subunit, which is induced by nitric oxide derived from nitric oxide synthase 2, facilitated subsequent sulfide-induced persulfidation of p65 and transcription of anti-apoptotic genes. These results uncover the molecular mechanism of the anti-apoptotic effects of sulfide based on the interaction between nitric oxide and sulfide. Exploitation of the anti-apoptotic effects of delayed hydrogen sulfide breathing may provide a new therapeutic approach for delayed paraplegia.",2019

The defective functionality of CVID patients' B cells could be the consequence of alterations in apoptosis regulation. We studied the balance of Bcl-2 family anti-/pro-apoptotic proteins to identify molecular mechanisms that could underlie B cell survival defects in CVID. We used flow cytometry to investigate Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bax, and Bim expression in B cells ex vivo and after anti-CD40 or anti-BCR activation with or without IL-21, besides to spontaneous and stimulation-induced Caspase-3 activation and viable/apoptotic B cell subpopulations.

30463183,Nutritional Regulators of Bcl-xL in the Brain.,"B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL) is an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein found in the mitochondrial membrane. Bcl-xL is reported to support normal brain development and protects neurons against toxic stimulation during pathological process via its roles in regulation of mitochondrial functions. Despite promising evidence showing neuroprotective properties of Bcl-xL, commonly applied molecular approaches such as genetic manipulation may not be readily applicable for human subjects. Therefore, findings at the bench may be slow to be translated into treatments for disease. Currently, there is no FDA approved application that specifically targets Bcl-xL and treats brain-associated pathology in humans. In this review, we will discuss naturally occurring nutrients that may exhibit regulatory effects on Bcl-xL expression or activity, thus potentially providing affordable, readily-applicable, easy, and safe strategies to protect the brain.",2018
30455436,Dynamic molecular monitoring reveals that SWI-SNF mutations mediate resistance to ibrutinib plus venetoclax in mantle cell lymphoma.,"Ibrutinib plus venetoclax is a highly effective combination in mantle cell lymphoma. However, strategies to enable the evaluation of therapeutic response are required. Our prospective analyses of patients within the AIM study revealed genomic profiles that clearly dichotomized responders and nonresponders. Mutations in ATM were present in most patients who achieved a complete response, while chromosome 9p21.1-p24.3 loss and/or mutations in components of the SWI-SNF chromatin-remodeling complex were present in all patients with primary resistance and two-thirds of patients with relapsed disease. Circulating tumor DNA analysis revealed that these alterations could be dynamically monitored, providing concurrent information on treatment response and tumor evolution. Functional modeling demonstrated that compromise of the SWI-SNF complex facilitated transcriptional upregulation of BCL2L1 (Bcl-xL) providing a selective advantage against ibrutinib plus venetoclax. Together these data highlight important insights into the molecular basis of therapeutic response and provide a model for real-time assessment of innovative targeted therapies.",2019

30452878,Sphingosine kinase 2 promotes lipotoxicity in pancreatic β-cells and the progression of diabetes.,"Loss of functional β-cell mass caused by lipotoxicity is a key pathogenic factor in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We have previously reported that sphingosine kinase (SK)1 is an endogenous protector of β-cells against lipotoxicity. The current study reports that SK2, another isoform of SK, is a crucial mediator of lipotoxicity in β-cells. Exposure of β-cells to palmitatic acid (PA), a saturated free fatty acid, resulted in a nearly 2-fold increase in SK2 expression, which paralleled the induction of cell death in a similar dose- and time-dependent fashion. Silencing SK2 expression by its specific small interfering RNAs significantly inhibited PA-induced cell death and caspase-3 activation, whereas overexpression of SK2 promoted lipotoxicity in β-cells. Mechanistically, upon exposure to PA, endogenous SK2 was shuttled from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it interacted with B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xL), leading to mitochondrial apoptotic pathway activation and cell death. By blocking SK2 translocation and its interaction with Bcl-xL, either the nuclear export signal mutant (L423A/L425A) or the BH3 domain mutant (L219A) of SK2 significantly attenuated β-cell lipotoxicity. Furthermore, SK2 deficiency in mice significantly prevented the loss of β-cell mass, preserved insulin production, and ameliorated the diabetic phenotype in an established T2DM model induced by feeding a high-fat diet accompanied by administration of streptozotocin. These findings provide the first evidence, in vitro and in vivo, of a critical role for SK2 in mediating β-cell lipotoxicity and the progression of diabetes.-Song, Z., Wang, W., Li, N., Yan, S., Rong, K., Lan, T., Xia, P.

Despite extensive studies on p73-mediated apoptosis, little is known about the cytoplasmic apoptotic function of p73. Here, using H1299 lung cancer cells and diverse biochemical approaches, including colony formation, DNA fragmentation, GST pulldown, and apoptosis assays along with NMR spectroscopy, we show that p73 induces transcription-independent apoptosis via its transactivation domain (TAD) through a mitochondrial pathway and that this apoptosis is mediated by the interaction between p73-TAD and the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-X",2018

30376609,SecinH3 Attenuates TDP-43 p.Q331K-Induced Neuronal Toxicity by Suppressing Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Enhancing Autophagic Flux.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, adult-onset, neurodegenerative disease. The transactivating response region DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) p.Q331K mutation (TDP-43 Q331K) has previously been identified in ALS as a disease-causing mutation with neurotoxicity. SecinH3, a cytohesin inhibitor, has neuroprotective effects against mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) toxicity. However, whether SecinH3 protects against mutant TDP-43 p.Q331K protein toxicity and its potential molecular mechanisms have not yet been investigated. To determine whether TDP-43 Q331K induces neuronal toxicity, SH-SY5Y, a human derived neuronal cell line were selected as an in vitro model of neuronal function. SH-SY5Y cells were transiently transfected with TDP-43 wild-type or TDP-43 Q331K. Remarkably, TDP-43 Q331K induced neuronal damage via endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis and the impairment of the autophagic flux. SecinH3 was demonstrated to successfully attenuate the TDP-43 Q331K-induced neuronal toxicity by suppressing ER stress-mediated apoptosis and enhancing the autophagic flux. Taken together, our in vitro study provided evidence that SecinH3 exerts neuroprotective effects against TDP-43 Q331K-mediated neuronal toxicity and was able to elucidate its mode of action. SecinH3 could, therefore, be considered a promising candidate as a therapeutic agent of ALS. © 2018 IUBMB Life, 71(1):192-199, 2019.",2019

30365047,Overexpression of miR‑361‑5p plays an oncogenic role in human lung adenocarcinoma through the regulation of SMAD2.,"The silencing of Bcl‑xL in the non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line, A549, downregulates miR‑361‑5p expression. This study aimed to determine the biological effects of miR‑361‑5p on NSCLC, and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which apoptosis is regulated. MicroRNA (miRNA or miR) functional analyses were performed via transfection of miR‑361‑5p mimics and inhibitors, demonstrating that the inhibition of miR‑361‑5p induced the apoptosis of NSCLC cells. To elucidate the function of miR‑361‑5p in vivo, cells transfected with miR‑361‑5p inhibitors were microinjected into zebrafish embryos, and immunostained using antibodies to detect the active form of caspase‑3. Co-transfection with siBcl‑xL and miR‑361‑5p mimics illustrated the association between Bcl‑xL, miR‑361‑5p and apoptosis; miR‑361‑5p mimics blocked the apoptosis initiated by siBcl‑xL. Luciferase reporter assays identified mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 (SMAD2) as a novel target of miR‑361‑5p and the reduction of its protein level was validated by western blot analysis. To confirm the molecular mechanisms through which apoptosis is regulated, gene rescue experiments revealed that the ectopic expression of SMAD2 attenuated the inhibitory effects on apoptosis induced by miR‑361‑5p. In this study, to the best of our knowledge, we provide the first evidence that miR‑361‑5p functions as an oncomiR in A549 and SK‑LU‑1 cells through the regulation of SMAD2, suggesting that miR‑361‑5p may be employed as a potential therapeutic target for the miRNA-based therapy of NSCLC.",2019
30361616,Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL are essential for survival of the developing nervous system.,"During neurogenesis, proliferating neural precursor cells (NPC) exit the cell cycle and differentiate into postmitotic neurons. The proteins that regulate cell survival through the stages of differentiation, however, are still poorly understood. Here, we examined the roles of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL, in promoting survival as cells progress through the stages of neurogenesis in the mouse embryonic central nervous system. We used Nestin-mediated, nervous system-specific conditional deletion of mcl-1, bcl-x or both to identify their distinct and overlapping roles. Individual conditional deletion of mcl-1 (MKO) and bcl-x (BKO) suggested sequential roles in promoting cell survival during developmental neurogenesis. In the MKO embryo, apoptosis begins at embryonic day 10 (E10) in the proliferating NPC population throughout the entire developing nervous system. In the BKO embryo, apoptosis begins later at E11 within the postmitotic neuron populations. In the double (mcl-1 and bcl-x) conditional knockout (DKO), cell death extended throughout both proliferating and non-proliferating cell populations resulting in embryonic lethality at E12, earlier than in either the MKO or BKO. Apoptotic cell death of the entire central nervous system in the DKO demonstrates that both genes are necessary for cell survival during developmental neurogenesis. To determine whether Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL have overlapping anti-apoptotic roles during neurogenesis, we examined the impact of gene dosage. Loss of a single bcl-x allele in the MKO embryo exasperated apoptotic cell death within the NPC population revealing a novel anti-apoptotic role for Bcl-xL in proliferating NPCs. Cells were rescued from apoptosis in both the MKO and BKO embryos by breeding with the Bax null mouse line indicating that Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL have a common pro-apoptotic target during developmental neurogenesis. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL are the two essential anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins required for the survival of the developing mammalian nervous system.",2019

30337641,Dual Inhibition of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and XPO1 is synthetically lethal in glioblastoma model systems.,"XPO1 has recently emerged as a viable treatment target for solid malignancies, including glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults. However, given that tumors become commonly resistant to single treatments, the identification of combination therapies is critical. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that inhibition of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and XPO1 are synthetically lethal. To this purpose, two clinically validated drug compounds, the BH3-mimetic, ABT263, and the XPO1 inhibitor, Selinexor, were used in preclinical GBM model systems. Our results show that inhibition of XPO1 reduces cellular viability in glioblastoma cell cultures. Moreover, addition of ABT263 significantly enhances the efficacy of XPO1 inhibition on the reduction of cellular viability, which occurs in a synergistic manner. While selinexor inhibits the proliferation of glioblastoma cells, the combination treatment of ABT263 and selinexor results in substantial induction of cell death, which is accompanied by activation of effector- initiator caspases and cleavage of PARP. Mechanistically we find that XPO1 inhibition results in down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 and attenuates ABT263 driven Mcl-1 up-regulation. Consistently, siRNA mediated silencing of Mcl-1 sensitizes for ABT263 mediated cell death and partially for the combination treatment. By using a human patient-derived xenograft model of glioblastoma in mice, we demonstrate that the combination treatment of ABT263 and Selinexor reduces tumor growth significantly more than each compound alone. Collectively, these results suggest that inhibition of XPO1 and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL might be a potential strategy for the treatment of malignant glial tumors.",2018

30273361,"Cytoprotective effect of 2-carbomethoxy-2,3-epoxy-3-prenyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (CMEP-NQ) is mediated by the inhibition of BAK-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.","The inhibitory mechanism of 2-carbomethoxy-2,3-epoxy-3-prenyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (CMEP-NQ) against apoptosis induced by the microtubule-damaging agents (MDAs), nocodazole (NOC) and 2-methoxyestradiol (2-MeO-E2), or a DNA-damaging agent (DDA), camptothecin (CPT) were investigated in human Jurkat T cell clones (J/Neo and J/BCL-XL cells). Treatment of J/Neo cells with NOC, 2-MeO-E2, or CPT caused cytotoxicity and apoptotic DNA fragmentation but these events were significantly attenuated in the presence of CMEP-NQ. Although not only MDA (NOC or 2-MeO-E2)-induced mitotic arrest, CDK1 activation, and BCL-2, BCL-XL and BIM phosphorylation, but also DDA (CPT)-induced S-phase arrest and ATM-CHK1/CHK2-p53 pathway activation were not or were barely affected in the presence of CMEP-NQ, the levels of anti-apoptotic BAG3 and MCL-1, which were markedly downregulated after MDA- or DDA-treatment, were rather elevated by CMEP-NQ. Under the same conditions, MDA- or DDA-induced mitochondrial apoptotic events including BAK activation, mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) loss, caspase-9 activation, and PARP cleavage were significantly inhibited by CMEP-NQ. While MDA- or DDA-induced sub-G1 peak and Δψm loss were abrogated in J/BCL-XL cells, MDA-induced mitotic arrest and DDA-induced S-arrest were more apparent in J/BCL-XL cells than in J/Neo cells. Simultaneously, the induced cell cycle arrest in J/BCL-XL cells was not significantly disturbed by CMEP-NQ. MDA- or DDA-treatment caused intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production; however, MDA- or DDA-induced ROS production was almost completely abrogated in J/BCL-XL cells. MDA- or DDA-induced ROS production in J/Neo cells was significantly suppressed by CMEP-NQ, but the suppressive effect was hardly observed in J/BCL-XL cells. Together, these results show that CMEP-NQ efficiently protects Jurkat T cells from apoptotic cell death via the elevation of BAG3 and MCL-1 levels, which results in the inhibition of intrinsic BAK-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, as does the overexpression of BCL-XL.",2018
30261081,Infection with flaviviruses requires BCLXL for cell survival.,"BCL2 family proteins including pro-survival proteins, BH3-only proteins and BAX/BAK proteins control mitochondria-mediated apoptosis to maintain cell homeostasis via the removal of damaged cells and pathogen-infected cells. In this study, we examined the roles of BCL2 proteins in the induction of apoptosis in cells upon infection with flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus, Dengue virus and Zika virus. We showed that survival of the infected cells depends on BCLXL, a pro-survival BCL2 protein due to suppression of the expression of another pro-survival protein, MCL1. Treatment with BCLXL inhibitors, as well as deficient BCLXL gene expression, induced BAX/BAK-dependent apoptosis upon infection with flaviviruses. Flavivirus infection attenuates cellular protein synthesis, which confers reduction of short-half-life proteins like MCL1. Inhibition of BCLXL increased phagocytosis of virus-infected cells by macrophages, thereby suppressing viral dissemination and chemokine production. Furthermore, we examined the roles of BCLXL in the death of JEV-infected cells during in vivo infection. Haploinsufficiency of the BCLXL gene, as well as administration of BH3 mimetic compounds, increased survival rate after challenge of JEV infection and suppressed inflammation. These results suggest that BCLXL plays a crucial role in the survival of cells infected with flaviviruses, and that BCLXL may provide a novel antiviral target to suppress propagation of the family of Flaviviridae viruses.",2018
30259416,Emerging ways to treat breast cancer: will promises be met?,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women and it is responsible for more than 40,000 deaths in the United States and more than 500,000 deaths worldwide each year. In previous decades, the development of improved screening, diagnosis and treatment methods has led to decreases in BC mortality rates. More recently, novel targeted therapeutic options, such as the use of monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors that target specific cancer cell-related components, have been developed. These components include ErbB family members (HER1, HER2, HER3 and HER4), Ras/MAPK pathway components (Ras, Raf, MEK and ERK), VEGF family members (VEGFA, VEGFB, VEGFC, VEGF and PGF), apoptosis and cell cycle regulators (BAK, BAX, BCL-2, BCL-X, MCL-1 and BCL-W, p53 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway components) and DNA repair pathway components such as BRCA1. In addition, long noncoding RNA inhibitor-, microRNA inhibitor/mimic- and immunotherapy-based approaches are being developed for the treatment of BC.

30250075,Sensitizing non-small cell lung cancer to BCL-xL-targeted apoptosis.,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of death in the United States, with non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) accounting for 85% of all cases. By analyzing the expression profile of the pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins, we have assigned NSCLCs into two distinct groups. While single agent treatment with the BCL-2/BCL-xL/BCL-w inhibitor ABT-263 (navitoclax) did not trigger apoptosis in either group, cells with a moderate to high level of MCL-1 expression were sensitive to ABT-263 treatment when MCL-1 expression was suppressed with a gene-specific siRNA. In contrast, those with a low MCL-1 expression did not undergo apoptosis upon combination treatment with ABT-263 and MCL-1 siRNA. Further studies revealed that cells with a low MCL-1 expression had low mitochondrial priming, and treatment with the chemotherapy drug docetaxel raised the mitochondrial priming level and consequently sensitized cells to ABT-263. These results establish a rationale for molecular profiling and a therapeutic strategy to treat NSCLC patients with pro-apoptotic anti-cancer drugs based on their MCL-1 expression level.",2018
30239926,Highly efficient genome editing via CRISPR-Cas9 in human pluripotent stem cells is achieved by transient BCL-XL overexpression.,"Genome editing of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is instrumental for functional genomics, disease modeling, and regenerative medicine. However, low editing efficiency has hampered the applications of CRISPR-Cas9 technology in creating knockin (KI) or knockout (KO) iPSC lines, which is largely due to massive cell death after electroporation with editing plasmids. Here, we report that the transient delivery of BCL-XL increases iPSC survival by ∼10-fold after plasmid transfection, leading to a 20- to 100-fold increase in homology-directed repair (HDR) KI efficiency and a 5-fold increase in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) KO efficiency. Treatment with a BCL inhibitor ABT-263 further improves HDR efficiency by 70% and KO efficiency by 40%. The increased genome editing efficiency is attributed to higher expressions of Cas9 and sgRNA in surviving cells after electroporation. HDR or NHEJ efficiency reaches 95% with dual editing followed by selection of cells with HDR insertion of a selective gene. Moreover, KO efficiency of 100% can be achieved in a bulk population of cells with biallelic HDR KO followed by double selection, abrogating the necessity for single cell cloning. Taken together, these simple yet highly efficient editing strategies provide useful tools for applications ranging from manipulating human iPSC genomes to creating gene-modified animal models.",2018
30237093,Simultaneous quantification of Cyt c interactions with HSP27 and Bcl-xL using molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based targeted proteomics.,"Cytochrome c (Cyt c) plays an important role in cell apoptosis. However, it could be functionally compromised by interaction with anti-apoptosis proteins, known as protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Among the proteins potentially interacting with Cyt c, both HSP27 and Bcl-xL serve as pivotal anti-apoptosis proteins. Because multiple PPIs, especially those involve the same protein, could affect each other, their simultaneous and quantitative detection is highly needed. In this study, a combined approach of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) and LC-MS/MS-based targeted proteomics was developed for simultaneous quantification of Cyt c-HSP27 and Cyt c-Bcl-xL interactions. Surrogate peptides of Cyt c, HSP27 and Bcl-xL were first selected and used for the corresponding proteins quantification in targeted proteomics analysis. For MIPs, epitope approach was employed and a short peptide of Cyt c was selected as template for protein complexes recognition and enrichment. The characteristics of the synthesized MIPs including adsorption capacity, kinetics and efficiency were then evaluated. After validation, this combined assay was applied to quantitative analysis of total Cyt c including Cyt c in mitochondria and cytosol, total HSP27, total Bcl-xL and Cyt c-HSP27 and Cyt c-Bcl-xL protein complexes in breast cells. The result was also compared with that using Co-IP/Western Blotting. SIGNIFICANCE: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are essential for many cellular processes and the changes of PPIs are often associated with cellular dysfunction. More importantly, each protein typically has more than one interaction partner and multiple PPIs, especially those involve the same protein, could affect each other. The selectivity of these interactions determines the activities of proteins and further the developmental potential of the cell. Thus, simultaneous and quantitative detection of multiple PPIs is highly needed in biological research and related disciplines. However, it is still challenging to even qualitatively or semi-quantitatively analyze multiple PPIs because of the limitations of current experimental techniques for interaction detection. In this study, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) epitope approach was combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) targeted proteomics for the simultaneous and quantitative detection of Cyt c-HSP27 and Cyt c-Bcl-xL interactions in breast cancer. Given high sensitivity, high selectivity and wide dynamic range of LC-MS/MS, MIPs approach was employed here to separate and enrich protein complexes prior to targeted proteomics analysis.",2019
30227325,15-HETE protects pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells against apoptosis via SIRT1 regulation during hypoxia.,"15-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) is produced by the catalytic metabolism of arachidonic acid by the enzyme 15-lipoxygenase. It is produced during hypoxia, and participates in the remodeling of pulmonary artery smooth muscle (PASM). Previous research has revealed that sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) involved in apoptosis in various cells and tissues. Herein, we attempted to determine whether 15-HETE counteracts SIRT1-promoted cell death in murine PASM cells (PASMCs). To verify this theory, we investigated changes in SIRT1 concentration in response to the counteraction of cell death by 15-HETE. We used western blotting and a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, and investigated the survival, nuclear morphology, and mitochondrial potential of the cells. Our results revealed that 15-HETE promotes the transcription and translation of SIRT1. Moreover, 15-HETE increases viability and impaired mitochondrial depolarization, and promotes the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in PASMCs without serum. The reactions mentioned above were eliminated by SIRT1 inhibitors (EX 527 and SIRT1 inhibitor IV). Our findings suggest that 15-HETE is crucial for the protection of PASMCs against cell death, and the SIRT1 pathway may provide a new strategy for pulmonary artery hypertension therapy.",2018
30185825,BH3-only proteins are dispensable for apoptosis induced by pharmacological inhibition of both MCL-1 and BCL-X,"The impressive selectivity and efficacy of BH3 mimetics for treating cancer has largely been limited to BCL-2 dependent hematological malignancies. Most solid tumors depend on other anti-apoptotic proteins, including MCL-1, for survival. The recent description of S63845 as the first specific and potent MCL-1 inhibitor represents an important therapeutic advance, since MCL-1 is not targeted by the currently available BH3 mimetics, Navitoclax or Venetoclax, and is commonly associated with chemoresistance. In this study, we confirm a high binding affinity and selectivity of S63845 to induce apoptosis in MCL-1-dependent cancer cell lines. Furthermore, S63845 synergizes with other BH3 mimetics to induce apoptosis in cell lines derived from both hematological and solid tumors. Although the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members in these cell lines interact with a spectrum of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins to regulate apoptosis, these interactions alone do not explain the relative sensitivities of these cell lines to BH3 mimetic-induced apoptosis. These findings necessitated further investigation into the requirement of BH3-only proteins in BH3 mimetic-mediated apoptosis. Concurrent inhibition of BCL-X",2019

30155742,Probing Gallate-Mediated Selectivity and High-Affinity Binding of Epigallocatechin Gallate: a Way-Forward in the Design of Selective Inhibitors for Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 Proteins.,"Selective inhibition is a key focus in the design of chemotherapeutic compounds that can abrogate the oncogenic activities of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Although recent efforts have led to the development of highly selective BH3 mimetics, setbacks such as toxicities have limited their use in cancer therapy. Epigallocatechingallate (EGCG) has been widely reported to selectively inhibit Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL compared to other green tea phenols due to its gallate group. Herein, we investigate the interaction dynamics of EGCG at the hydrophobic grooves of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and the consequential effects on their BH4 domains. Arg143 and Asp108 (Bcl-2), and Glu96 and Tyr195 (Bcl-xL) formed high-affinity hydrogen interactions with the gallate group while non-gallate groups of EGCG formed weak interactions. EGCG-bound proteins showed systemic perturbations of BH4 domains coupled with the burial of crucial surface-exposed residues such as Lys17 (Bcl-2) and Asp11 (Bcl-xL); hence, a distortion of non-canonical domain interactions. Interactions of gallate group of EGCG with key hydrophobic groove residues underlie EGCG selectivity while concurrent BH4 domain perturbations potentiate EGCG inhibitory activities. Findings will aid the optimization and design of selective inhibitors that could suppress anti-apoptotic activities of Bcl2-family proteins with minimal toxicities.",2019

However, no available reports show that quercetin induces apoptosis and altered associated gene expressions in human gastric cancer cells, thus, we investigated the effect of quercetin on the apoptotic cell death and associated gene expression in human gastric cancer AGS cells. Results indicated that quercetin induced cell morphological changes and reduced total viability via apoptotic cell death in AGS cells. Furthermore, results from flow cytometric assay indicated that quercetin increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, decreased the levels of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ",2018
30135191,Dose and Schedule Determine Distinct Molecular Mechanisms Underlying the Efficacy of the p53-MDM2 Inhibitor HDM201.,"Activation of p53 by inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 interaction is being pursued as a therapeutic strategy in p53 wild-type cancers. Here, we report distinct mechanisms by which the novel, potent, and selective inhibitor of the p53-MDM2 interaction HDM201 elicits therapeutic efficacy when applied at various doses and schedules. Continuous exposure of HDM201 led to induction of p21 and delayed accumulation of apoptotic cells. By comparison, high-dose pulses of HDM201 were associated with marked induction of PUMA and a rapid onset of apoptosis. shRNA screens identified PUMA as a mediator of the p53 response specifically in the pulsed regimen. Consistent with this, the single high-dose HDM201 regimen resulted in rapid and marked induction of PUMA expression and apoptosis together with downregulation of Bcl-xL ",2018
30132509,Resveratrol promotes the sensitivity of small-cell lung cancer H446 cells to cisplatin by regulating intrinsic apoptosis.,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of resveratrol on small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell proliferation and apoptosis. The results demonstrated that resveratrol concentration- and time-dependently reduced H446 cell viability. In addition, cells treated with resveratrol displayed higher apoptotic rates, in association with mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome c release from the mitochondrial compartment to the cytoplasm, apoptosis-inducing factor translocation from the mitochondrial compartment to the nucleus, and altered protein levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bax. Furthermore, resveratrol promoted H446 cell inhibition by cisplatin, as reflected by reduced viability and increased apoptosis. These findings suggest that resveratrol exerts antitumor effects on SCLC H446 cells and promotes H446 cell killing by cisplatin via modulation of intrinsic apoptosis.",2018
30130653,Lysosomal permeabilization and endoplasmic reticulum stress mediate the apoptotic response induced after photoactivation of a lipophilic zinc(II) phthalocyanine.,"We have previously reported that the phototoxic action of the lipophilic phthalocyanine Pc9 (2,9(10),16(17),23(24) tetrakis[(2-dimethylamino)ethylsulfanyl]phthalocyaninatozinc(II)) encapsulated into poloxamine micelles is related to the induction of an apoptotic response in murine colon CT26 carcinoma cells. In the present study, we explored the intracellular signals contributing to the resulting apoptotic death. We found that Pc9-T1107 arrests cell cycle progression immediately after irradiation promoting then an apoptotic response. Thus, 3 h after irradiation the percentage of hypodiploid cells increased from 5.9 ± 0.6% to 23.1 ± 0.1%; activation of caspases 8 and 9 was evident; the population of cells with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential increased from 1.1 ± 0.4% to 44.0 ± 9.3%; the full-length forms of Bid and PARP-1 were cleaved; and a 50% decrease of the expression levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-X",2018
30104976,Qiang-Xin 1 Formula Prevents Sepsis-Induced Apoptosis in Murine Cardiomyocytes by Suppressing Endoplasmic Reticulum- and Mitochondria-Associated Pathways.,"Sepsis is reported to be an unusual systemic reaction to infection, accompanied by multiple-organ failure. Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SIC), defined as damages and dysfunction of the heart, is essential in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Traditional Chinese formula, which has long been used to improve the situation of patients through multitarget regulation, is now gradually being used as complementary therapy. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of Qiang-Xin 1 (QX1) formula, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine designed for cardiac dysfunction, on cecal ligation puncture (CLP)-induced heart damage and its underlying mechanisms in mice. Survival test first showed that an oral administration of QX1 formula significantly increased the 7-days survival of septic mice from 22 to 40%. By estimating the secretion of serum cytokines, QX1 treatment dramatically inhibited the excessive production of interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α. Immunohistochemical staining illustrated that the expression of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, caspase-12, and high-mobility group box 1 was downregulated in cardiomyocytes of the QX1-treated group compared with that of the CLP surgery group. Western blotting confirmed that the activation of essential caspase family members, such as caspase-3, caspase-9, and caspase-12, was prohibited by treatment with QX1. Moreover, the abnormal expression of key regulators of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria-associated apoptosis in cardiomyocytes of septic mice, including CHOP, GRP78, Cyt-c, Bcl-2, Bcl-X",2018
30098330,Sirtuin 5 overexpression attenuates glucolipotoxicity-induced pancreatic β cells apoptosis and dysfunction.,"Recently, SIRT5 was reported to be a predominant desuccinylase and demalonylase in mitochondria. Ablation of SIRT5 enhances the systemic succinylation and malonylation of mitochondrial proteins, including various metabolic enzymes; however, its function in pancreatic β cells has not yet been clarified. In this study, we evaluated the effects of SIRT5 overexpression on glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis in β cell lines. Full-length SIRT5, which preferentially targeted to mitochondria and partially to the nucleus and cytoplasm, was overexpressed in NIT-1 cells. Chronic exposure to excess palmitate and glucose (High-PA-G) induced apoptosis and suppressed glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in β cells. SIRT5 overexpression significantly alleviated apoptosis under the High-PA-G condition, accompanied by suppressed Caspase 3 activity and reduced malondialdehyde levels. SIRT5 overexpression also improved β cell secretory capacity in response to glucose under the High-PA-G condition, suggesting its protective role in β cell function. Furthermore, SIRT5 overexpression reversed the decreasing trend of anti-apoptotic factors BCL-2 and BCL-XL expression under High-PA-G condition. Further regulation mechanisms between SIRT5 and these anti-apoptotic factors remains to be explored in future studies. Our data reveal that SIRT5 is a potentially protective factor for pancreatic β cells against glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis and cell dysfunction.",2018
30096328,Neuronal preservation and reactive gliosis attenuation following neonatal sciatic nerve axotomy by a fluorinated cannabidiol derivative.,"Immature peripheral nervous system damage, such as the transection of a peripheral nerve, results in the extensive degeneration of motoneurons and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons, mostly due to apoptotic events. We have previously shown that cannabidiol (CBD), the most abundant non-psychotropic molecule present in the Cannabis sativa plant, exhibits neuroprotective action when administered daily at a dose of 15 mg/kg. This study shows that use of the fluorinated synthetic version of CBD (4'-fluoro-cannabidiol, HUF-101) significantly improves neuronal survival by 2-fold compared to that achieved with traditional CBD at one-third the dose. Furthermore, we show that HUF-101 administration significantly upregulates anti-apoptotic genes and blocks the expression of pro-apoptotic nuclear factors. Two-day-old Wistar rats were subjected to unilateral sectioning of the sciatic nerve and treated daily with HUF-101 (1, 2.5, 5 mg/kg/day, i.p.) or a vehicle solution for five days. The results were evaluated by Nissl staining, immunohistochemistry, and qRT-PCR. Neuronal counting revealed a 47% rescue of spinal motoneurons and a 79% rescue of DRG neurons (HUF-101, 5 mg/kg). Survival was associated with complete depletion of p53 and a 60-fold elevation in BCL2-like 1 gene expression. Additionally, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) gene expression was downregulated by 80%. Neuronal preservation was coupled with a high preservation of synaptic coverage and a reduction in astroglial and microglial reactions that were evaluated in nearby spinal motoneurons present in the ventral horn of the lumbar intumescence. Overall, these data strongly indicate that HUF-101 exerts potent neuroprotective effects that are related to anti-apoptotic protection and the reduction of glial reactivity.",2018
30075205,Hypertonicity-imposed BCL-XL addiction primes colorectal cancer cells for death.,"Induction of mitochondria-controlled (intrinsic) apoptosis is a mainstay of current anti-neoplastic chemotherapies. Activation of this death pathway is counteracted by BCL-2-like proteins, which functionally set the threshold for apoptosis and determine whether malignant cells are sensitive or resistant to anti-cancer treatments. Hence, unlocking the intrinsic apoptotic cascade and promoting the cell's commitment to undergo apoptosis concordantly promotes efficacy of anti-cancer treatments. Here, we show that hyperosmotic stress enforces addiction of colorectal cancer cells to BCL-XL, thereby exhausting the protective capacity of BCL-2-like proteins and priming mitochondria for death. Our work identifies osmotic pressure as a cell extrinsic factor that modulates responsiveness of colorectal cancer cells to therapy.",2018

29968967,2.45 GHz microwave radiation induced oxidative and nitrosative stress mediated testicular apoptosis: Involvement of a p53 dependent bax-caspase-3 mediated pathway.,Deleterious effects of MW radiation on the male reproduction are well studied. Previous reports although suggest that 2.45 GHz MW irradiation induced oxidative and nitrosative stress adversely affects the male reproductive function but the detailed molecular mechanism occurring behind it has yet to be elucidated. The aim of present study was to investigate the underlying detailed pathway of the testicular apoptosis induced by free radical load and redox imbalance due to 2.45 GHz MW radiation exposure and the degree of severity along with the increased exposure duration. Twelve-week old male mice were exposed to 2.45 GHz MW radiation [continuous-wave (CW) with overall average Power density of 0.0248 mW/cm,2018
29968959,Coronarin D induces apoptotic cell death through the JNK pathway in human hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Coronarin D, a diterpene derived from the rhizomes of Hedychium coronarium, has been used to treat inflammatory diseases. Coronarin D can exert strong anticancer effects through cell growth prevention and cell cycle arrest in many cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism through which coronarin D suppresses cell proliferation and triggers cell death in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Treatment of Huh7 and Sk-hep-1 cells with coronarin D resulted in a significantly increased loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to the cleavage and activation of caspase-9, caspase-8, and caspase-3 and changes in Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL protein levels. Coronarin D significantly induced autophagy by increasing the expression of Beclin-1 and LC3-II and reducing the expression of p62. Moreover, Huh7 and Sk-hep-1 cells exposed to coronarin D had decreased expression of phosphorylated AKT, p38, and ERK and increased expression of phosphorylated JNK. Exposure of cells to the JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 attenuated the apoptotic effects of coronarin D. Taken together, this is the first study to report that coronarin D may effectively inhibit cell growth through apoptosis. We have provided evidence indicating that coronarin D induces cell death through the upregulation of JNK mitogen-activated protein kinases in human HCC cells.",2018
29949238,C1q/TNF-related peptide 8 (CTRP8) promotes temozolomide resistance in human glioblastoma.,"The C1q/TNF-related peptide 8 (CTRP8) has recently emerged as a novel ligand of the G protein-coupled receptor RXFP1 in the fatal brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM). We previously demonstrated that the CTRP8-RXFP1 ligand-receptor system promotes motility and matrix invasion of patient GBM and U87 MG cells by specific phosphorylation of PI3 kinase and protein kinase C. Here, we demonstrate a novel role for CTRP8 in protecting human GBM cells against the DNA alkylating damage of temozolomide (TMZ), the standard chemotherapy drug used to treat GBM. This DNA protective role of CTRP8 required a functional RXFP1-STAT3 signaling cascade in GBM cells. We identified N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase (MPG), a monofunctional glycosylase that initiates base excision repair pathway by generating an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site, as a new CTRP8-RXFP1-STAT3 target in GBM. Upon TMZ exposure, treatment with CTRP8 reduced the formation of AP sites and double-strand DNA breaks in GBM cells. This CTRP8 effect was independent of cellular MGMT levels and was associated with decreased caspase 3/7 activity and increased survival of human GBM. CTRP8-induced RXFP1 activation caused an increase in cellular protein levels of the anti-apoptotic Bcl members and STAT3 targets Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL in human GBM. Collectively, our results demonstrate a novel multipronged and clinically relevant mechanism by which the CTRP8-RXFP1 ligand-receptor system exerts a DNA protective function against TMZ chemotherapeutic stress in GBM. This CTRP8-RXFP1-STAT3 axis is a novel determinant of TMZ responsiveness/chemoresistance and an emerging new drug target for improved treatment of human GBM.",2018
29924730,"Selective BH3-mimetics targeting BCL-2, BCL-XL or MCL-1 induce severe mitochondrial perturbations.","Induction of apoptosis by selective BH3-mimetics is currently investigated as a novel strategy for cancer treatment. Here, we report that selective BH3-mimetics induce apoptosis in a variety of hematological malignancies. Apoptosis is accompanied by severe mitochondrial toxicities upstream of caspase activation. Specifically, the selective BH3-mimetics ABT-199, A-1331852 and S63845, which target BCL-2, BCL-XL and MCL-1, respectively, induce comparable ultrastructural changes including mitochondrial swelling, a decrease of mitochondrial matrix density and severe loss of cristae structure.

Triple negative breast cancer, an aggressive form of breast cancer, is characterized by elevated glycolysis, while estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells rely predominantly on OXPHOS. BCL2 proteins control the process of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization during apoptosis, but also regulate cellular bioenergetics. Because BCL2 proteins are overexpressed in breast cancer and targetable by selective antagonists, we here analysed the effect of BCL2 and BCL(X)L selective inhibitors, Venetoclax and WEHI-539, on mitochondrial bioenergetics and cell death. Employing single cell imaging using a FRET-based mitochondrial ATP sensor, we found that MCF7 breast cancer cells supplied with mitochondrial substrates reduced their mitochondrial ATP production when treated with Venetoclax or WEHI-539 at concentrations that ",2018

29886136,Activated grass carp STAT6 up-regulates the transcriptional level and expression of CCL20 and Bcl-xl.,"In mammals, signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) is a broad-spectrum transcriptional regulator involved in cellular immune responses and apoptosis by regulating the immune-related genes and various functional genes. The structure, expression and tyrosine-based phosphorylation of STAT6 are conserved from fish to mammal. However, except the sporadic reports from zebra fish, the function of fish STAT6 has not been well reported. Here, we cloned and characterized the full length cDNA sequence of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) STAT6 (CiSTAT6). Meanwhile, the activation mechanism and the potential function of CiSTAT6 were studied. The full length cDNA of CiSTAT6 is 2747 bp with an ORF of 2313 bp encoding a polypeptide of 770 amino acids. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that CiSTAT6 shares the maximum homology with Cyprinus carpio STAT6. CiSTAT6 was significantly up-regulated and interacted with each other to form the homodimer after treatment with poly I:C. The transfected CiSTAT6 in fish cell lines can activate the promoter activities of CCL20 and Bcl-xl and increase their mRNA levels. In addition, we also found that CiSTAT6 can increase cell viability and inhibit cell apoptosis. Taken together, grass carp STAT6 plays an important part in innate immunity and anti-apoptosis.",2018

However, the underlying mechanism of miR‑205 in thyroid cancer remains unclear. In the present study, it was demonstrated that the expression of miR‑205 was reduced in thyroid cancer tissues compared with non‑cancer tissues. In addition, miR‑205‑knockdown models in the BHT‑101 cell line and ectopic expression models in the 8505‑C cell line were used to measure the biological functions of miR‑205. The results indicated that miR‑205 inhibited certain aspects of thyroid cancer, including cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Furthermore, Yes‑associated protein 1 (YAP1) was identified as a target gene of miR‑205 and its expression was negatively correlated with that of miR‑205 in thyroid cancer tissues. Depletion of YAP1 partially reduced the anti‑miR‑205‑induced cell growth and invasion. The results of the present study suggested that the tumor suppressive functions of miR‑205 via targeting YAP1 could be a novel target for the treatment of thyroid cancer.",2018

29775995,Phosphorylation alters Bim-mediated Mcl-1 stabilization and priming.,"Mcl-1 is a highly labile protein, subject to extensive post-translational regulation. This distinguishes Mcl-1 from other antiapoptotic proteins and necessitates further study to better understand how interactions with proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins affect its regulation. One such protein, Bim, is known to stabilize Mcl-1, and Bim phosphorylation has been associated with increased Mcl-1 binding. Consequently, we investigated the potential impact of Bim phosphorylation on Mcl-1 stability. We found that Bim stabilizes and primes Mcl-1 in RPCI-WM1 cells and is constitutively phosphorylated. Additionally, introduction of several phospho-mimetic and unphosphosphorylateable Bim mutations resulted in altered Mcl-1 stability and distinct Bim binding to antiapoptotic proteins. These findings suggest Bim phosphorylation not only regulates Mcl-1 stability but also is a potential mechanism for enforcing Mcl-1 dependence.",2018

29741767,"Down-regulation of intracellular anti-apoptotic proteins, particularly c-FLIP by therapeutic agents; the novel view to overcome resistance to TRAIL.","Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL or Apo2L) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily that induces apoptosis in different types of cancer cells via activation of caspase cascade. TRAIL interacts with its cognate receptors that placed on cancer cells surface, including TRAIL-R1 (death receptor 4, DR4), TRAIL-R2 (death receptor 5, DR5), TRAIL-R3 (decoy receptor 1, DcR1), TRAIL-R4 (decoy receptor 2, DcR2), and osteoprotegerin (OPG). Despite high apoptosis-inducing ability of TRAIL, various cancerous cells gain resistance to TRAIL gradually, and consequently TRAIL potential for apoptosis stimulation in these cells diminishes intensely. According to diverse ranges of examinations, intracellular anti-apoptotic proteins, such as cellular-FLICE inhibitory protein (c-FLIP), apoptosis inhibitors (IAPs), myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL-1), BCL-2, BCL-XL, and survivin play key role in cancer cells resistance to TRAIL. These proteins attenuate cancer cells sensitivity to TRAIL via various functions, importantly through caspase cascade suppression. The c-FLIP avoids from caspase 8 activation by FADD via binding to caspase 8 cleavage of FADD. Moreover, it activates signaling pathways that involved in cancer cells survival and proliferation. Intriguingly, it appears that the down-regulation of intracellular anti-apoptotic proteins, particularly c-FLIP is effectiveness goal for TRAIL-resistant cancers therapy, because their up-regulation in association with poor prognosis has been observed in various types of TRAIL-resistant cancers. In this review, we tried to collect and examine investigations that researchers have been able to sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL through targeting of c-FLIP alone or with other intracellular anti-apoptotic proteins directly or indirectly. It seems that co-treatment of resistant cells by TRAIL with other therapeutic agents with the aim of intracellular anti-apoptotic proteins inhibition is hopeful and attractive approach to overcome various TRAIL-resistant cancers.",2018

Oxidative stress and mitophagy during hypoxia are crucial to cause aggregation of these lipofuscin granules in hypoxic neurons. Salidroside, a glucoside derivative of β-Tyrosol, has been reported to protect hypoxic neurons through maintenance of mitochondrial activity. The present study is aimed at investigating the potential of Salidroside in preventing mitophagy during chronic hypoxia and identification of the molecular targets and underlying signaling mechanisms.

29715457,SPG6 supports development of acute myeloid leukemia by regulating BMPR2-Smad-Bcl-2/Bcl-xl signaling.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults. To effectively treat AML, new molecular targets and therapeutic approaches must be identified. In silico analysis of several available databases of AML patients showed that the expression of Spastic Paraplegia 6 Protein (SPG6) significantly inversely correlates with the overall survival of AML patients. To determine whether SPG6 supports AML development, we employed an shRNA-encoding lentivirus system to inhibit SPG6 expression in human AML cells including NB4 and MV4-11 cells. Knockdown expression of SPG6 resulted in decreased cell growth and elevated apoptosis of these leukemia cells. Notably, the SPG6 deficiency resulted in higher BMPR2 expression indicating that BMPR2 signaling contributes to AML pathogenesis. Furthermore, SPG6 deficiency promoted phosphorylation of Smad1/5/9 and decreased transcription of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl. Our study suggests that SPG6 contributes to AML pathogenesis, and suggests that inhibition of SPG6 may be novel strategy for treating human AML.",2018
29709701,Co-targeting of BET proteins and HDACs as a novel approach to trigger apoptosis in rhabdomyosarcoma cells.,"Histone acetylation marks exert essential functions in regulating gene expression. These marks are written by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), removed by histone deacetylases (HDACs) and read by e.g. BET proteins. While BET inhibitors are promising new anticancer drugs, little is yet known about their antitumor activity in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). We therefore investigated the efficacy of the prototypic BET inhibitor JQ1 alone or in combination with other epigenetic modifiers, namely HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs). Here, we discover a synergistic interaction of the panBET inhibitor JQ1 together with various HDACIs, i.e. Quisinostat (JNJ-26481585), Vorinostat (SAHA), Entinostat (MS-275) and Panobinostat (LBH589), inducing apoptosis in RMS cells, whereas JQ1 as single agent exhibits little cytotoxicity. Calculation of combination index (CI) confirmed the synergism of this combination. Importantly, JQ1 and JNJ-26481585 act in concert to suppress colony formation and to trigger apoptosis in an in vivo model. Mechanistic studies revealed that combination of JQ1 and JNJ-26481585 cooperatively upregulates BIM and BMF, while downregulating BCL-x",2018

31314416,Roles of Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors in the Pathology and Treatment of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases,"Both of the two most common neurodegenerative disorders, namely Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), have multiple lines of evidence, from molecular and cellular to epidemiological, that nicotinic transmission is implicated in those pathogenesis. This review presents evidences of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)-mediated protection against neurotoxicity induced by β amyloid (Aβ), glutamate, rotenone, and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and the signal transduction involved in this mechanism. Our studies clarified that survival signal transduction, α7 nAChR-Src family-PI3K-AKT pathway and subsequent upregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x, would lead to neuroprotection. Recently analyzing the properties of galantamine, we clarified the neuroprotective pathway, which is mediated by enhancement of microglial α7 nAChR resulting in upregulation of Aβ phagocytosis.

29571250,Baicalein sensitizes hepatocellular carcinoma cells to 5-FU and Epirubicin by activating apoptosis and ameliorating P-glycoprotein activity.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a dismal prognosis in part because of multi-drug resistance (MDR). Baicalein is a flavonoid extracted from Radix Scutellariae with anti-HCC activity. We tested the effects of Baicalein on multi-drug resistant HCC cells (Bel7402/5-FU) known to be resistant to the anticancer drugs 5-FU and Epirubicin. Flow cytometry analysis showed that treatment with 5??g/ml and 10??g/ml Baicalein resulted in increases in the intra-cellular concentrations of Rho123 and Epirubicin in the corresponding group of cells compared to untreated cells, illustrating that Baicalein reverses MDR in Bel7402/5-FU cells. Bel7402/5-FU cells displayed increased P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated drug efflux. However, this efflux was inhibited in cells pre-incubated in Baicalein for 48?h. Moreover, Baicalein induced apoptosis and autophagy and decreased P-gp and Bcl-xl expression levels. All of these results indicate that Baicalein can reverse P-gp-mediated MDR in HCC and may thus be useful for the treatment of drug-resistant HCC.",2018
29565269,Food Additive Sodium Benzoate (NaB) Activates NFκB and Induces Apoptosis in HCT116 Cells.,"NaB, the metabolite of cinnamon and sodium salt of benzoic acid is a commonly used food and beverage preservative. Various studies have investigated NaB for its effects on different cellular models. However, the effects of NaB on cancer cell viability signaling is substantially unknown. In this study, the effects of NaB on viability parameters and NFκB, one of the most important regulators in apoptosis, were examined in HCT116 colon cancer cells. Cell culture, light microscopy, spectrophotometry, flow cytometry, and western blot were used as methods to determine cell viability, caspase-3 activity, NFκB, Bcl-xl, Bim, and PARP proteins, respectively. NaB (6.25 mM-50 mM) treatment inhibited cell viability by inducing apoptosis, which was evident with increased Annexin V-PE staining and caspase-3 activity. NFκB activation accompanied the induction of apoptosis in NaB treated cells. Inhibition of NFκB with BAY 11-7082 did not show a pronounced effect on cell viability but induced a more apoptotic profile, which was confirmed by increased PARP fragmentation and caspase-3 activity. This effect was mostly evident at 50 mM concentration of NaB. Bcl-xl levels were not affected by NaB or BAY 11-7082/NaB treatment; whereas, total Bim increased with NaB treatment. Inhibition of NFκB activity further increased Bim levels. Overall, these results suggest that NaB induces apoptosis and activates NFκB in HCT116 colon cancer cells. Activation of NFκB emerges as target in an attempt to protect cells against apoptosis.",2018
29547833,Induction of cell killing and autophagy by amphiphilic pyrrolidine derivatives on human pancreatic cancer cells.,"We have synthesized a wide array of structurally related amphiphilic compounds, containing a functionalized pyrrolidine polar group coupled to different ether-linked hydrocarbon chains, to generate novel structures with antitumor activity. These newly synthesized amphiphilic pyrrolidine-derived compounds were classified in three different sub-libraries regarding the number of hydroxyl groups substituting the pyrrolidine moiety at C3 and C4. Pyrrolidine compounds with one or none hydroxyl groups showed a potent cell killing activity against pancreatic cancer cells, but they lacked selectivity for tumor cells. Pyrrolidine compounds with two hydroxyl groups induced cell death in a wide variety of pancreatic cancer cell lines, and they were somewhat less cytotoxic to normal non-tumor cells. Among these latter compounds, the diol-derived pyrrolidine 20 ((2R,3R,4S)-2-{(9Z)-hexadec-9-en-1-yloxy]methyl}pyrrolidine-3,4-diol) induced autophagy and a potent apoptotic response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells, which was inhibited by Bcl-X",2018

Although BCR-induced proliferation is essential for GC reactions, the function of Bach2 in regulating B cell proliferation has not been elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that Bach2 is required to sustain high levels of B cell proliferation in response to BCR signaling. Following BCR engagement in vitro, B cells from ",2018
29523777,Intracellular Desmoglein-2 cleavage sensitizes epithelial cells to apoptosis in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines.,"Desmosomal cadherins mediate intercellular adhesion and have also been shown to regulate homeostatic signaling in epithelial cells. We have previously reported that select pro-inflammatory cytokines induce Dsg2 ectodomain cleavage and shedding from intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Dsg2 extracellular cleaved fragments (Dsg2 ECF) function to induce paracrine pro-proliferative signaling in epithelial cells. In this study, we show that exposure of IECs to pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) resulted in Dsg2 intracellular cleavage and generation of a ~55 kDa fragment (Dsg2 ICF). Dsg2 intracellular cleavage is mediated by caspase-8 and occurs prior to Dsg2 extracellular cleavage and the execution of apoptosis. Expression of exogenous Dsg2 ICF in model IECs resulted in increased sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli and apoptosis execution. Additionally, expression of the Dsg2 ICF repressed the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member proteins Bcl-X",2018
29507230,Transmembrane E3 ligase RNF183 mediates ER stress-induced apoptosis by degrading Bcl-xL.,"The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causes ER stress and triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR). Failure to resolve ER stress leads to apoptotic cell death via a yet unclear mechanism. Here, we show that RNF183, a membrane-spanning RING finger protein, localizes to the ER and exhibits classic E3 ligase activities. Sustained ER stress induced by different treatments increases RNF183 protein levels posttranscriptionally in an IRE1α-dependent manner. Activated IRE1 reduces the level of miR-7, which increases the stability of RNF183 transcripts. In addition, overexpression of RNF183 leads to increased apoptosis and its depletion alleviates ER stress-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, RNF183 interacts with Bcl-xL, an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, and polyubiquitinates Bcl-xL for degradation. Thus, RNF183 plays an important role in executing programmed cell death upon prolonged ER stress, likely by inducing apoptosis through Bcl-xL.",2018
29498802,Differential effects of Vav-promoter-driven overexpression of BCLX and BFL1 on lymphocyte survival and B cell lymphomagenesis.,"Overexpression of BCLX and BFL1/A1 has been reported in various human malignancies and is associated with poor prognosis and drug resistance, identifying these prosurvival BCL2 family members as putative drug targets. We have generated transgenic mice that express human BFL1 or human BCLX protein throughout the haematopoietic system under the control of the Vav gene promoter. Haematopoiesis is normal in both the Vav-BFL1 and Vav-BCLX transgenic (TG) mice and susceptibility to spontaneous haematopoietic malignancies is not increased. Lymphoid cells from Vav-BCLX TG mice exhibit increased resistance to apoptosis in vitro while most blood cell types form Vav-BFL1 TG mice were poorly protected. Both transgenes significantly accelerated lymphomagenesis in Eμ-MYC TG mice and, surprisingly, the Vav-BFL1 transgene was the more potent. Unexpectedly, expression of transgenic BFL1 RNA and protein is significantly elevated in B lymphoid cells of Vav-BFL1/Eμ-MYC double-transgenic compared to Vav-BFL1 mice, even during the preleukaemic phase, providing a rationale for the potent synergy. In contrast, Vav-BCLX expression was not notably different. These mouse models of BFL1 and BCLX overexpression in lymphomas should be useful tools for the testing the efficacy of novel human BFL1- and BCLX-specific inhibitors.",2018
29476339,"Role of glutathione, ROS, and Bcl-xL in the inhibition of apoptosis of monocyte-derived dendritic cells by Leishmania mexicana promastigotes.","Dendritic cells (DCs) are one of the principal host cells of the obligate intracellular parasite Leishmania that can survive and reproduce within cells due to the ability to regulate different cellular events, including apoptosis. Inhibition of host cell apoptosis is a strategy employed by multiple pathogens to ensure their survival in the infected cell. We have previously reported that Leishmania mexicana promastigotes and amastigotes inhibit camptothecin-induced apoptosis of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) through the downregulation of p38 and JNK phosphorylation. The upregulation of glutathione (GSH), the most important regulator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration, has proven to protect cells from apoptosis through the inhibition of JNK1. Another mechanism employed by cells for the protection of apoptosis is the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family. The aim of this study was to determine if GSH, ROS, and Bcl-xL participate in the inhibition of camptothecin-induced apoptosis of moDC by L. mexicana promastigotes. GSH quantification assays showed that camptothecin and BSO (an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis) strongly decreased intracellular GSH concentration in moDC, while infection with L. mexicana promastigotes had no effect in the level of GSH. On the other hand, infection with L. mexicana promastigotes of BSO- and camptothecin-treated moDC diminished the concentration of ROS and induced the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL. Our findings suggest that inhibition of camptothecin-induced apoptosis of moDC by L. mexicana promastigotes is preferentially regulated by the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family rather than by the redox status of the cell.",2018
29472583,Antitumor activities of Quercetin and Green Tea in xenografts of human leukemia HL60 cells.,"Quercetin is one of the most abundant flavonoids, present in fruits and vegetables and has been shown to have multiple properties capable of reducing cell growth in cancer cells. Green tea is a widely consumed beverage, known for a potential source of free radical scavenging and anti-cancer activities. Herein, we investigate the in vivo antitumor efficacy of quercetin and green tea in human leukemia. Human tumors were xenografted into NOD/SCID mice. Quercetin and green tea reduced tumor growth in HL-60 xenografts accompanied by decreased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, BCL-2, BCL-XL and MCL-1 and increased expression of BAX, a pro-apoptotic protein. Moreover, caspase-3 was activated to a greater extent after quercetin and green tea treatment. Quercetin and green tea also mediated G1 phase cell cycle arrest in HL-60 xenografts. Treatment with quercetin and green tea induced conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II as well as activation of autophagy proteins, suggesting that quercetin and green tea initiate the autophagic progression. We have provided evidence that quercetin and green tea induces signaling at the level of apoptosis, cell cycle and autophagy which converge to antigrowth effects in HL-60 xenograft mice suggesting that these compounds may be a compelling ally in cancer treatment.",2018
29453135,Dual inhibitors of the pro-survival proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 derived from natural compound meiogynin A.,"Thirty analogues of natural meiogynin A, a pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor, were prepared in order to elaborate cytotoxic compounds on specific cancer cells overexpressing one or more proteins of the Bcl-2 family. The interaction of all the new analogues with Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 proteins was first evaluated by fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) and showed that modulation of the lateral chain has a dramatic impact as subtle changes significantly modify the activity on the target proteins. The acetoxymethyl prodrugs of the two most active compounds were then elaborated to determine their cytotoxicity on B cell lines. A strong cytotoxic effect on BL2, RS4;11 and H929 cells was observed with a triazole prodrug that induces apoptosis.",2018
29441858,Inhibitory effects of 2-methoxyestradiol on cell growth and invasion in human bladder cancer T-24 cells.,"Recently, 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME) has been considered to be a potential anticancer agent but has not been investigated in bladder cancer. This study was conducted to clarify the role of 2-ME in bladder cancer cells. The bladder cancer cell line T-24 was treated with 2 μm 2-ME for 2 d. The T-24 cell viability, colony formation, invasion and apoptosis were observed in 2-ME-treated and control cells. The expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) was detected using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Then western blotting assay was applied to assess expressions of HIF-1α and apoptosis factors caspase-3 and Bcl-x proteins. The mRNA and protein expressions of HIF-1α in 2-ME-treated T-24 cells were remarkably lower than that of the control cells (P < 0.05). Treatment of 2-ME could significantly inhibit T-24 the cell viability, colony formation, invasion, and promote apoptosis (all P < 0.05). In addition, the protein expression of Caspase-3 was higher and that of Bcl-x protein was lower after administration of 2-ME compared to control (both P < 0.05). Collectively, we characterized the efficacy of 2-ME on bladder cancer T-24 cells as being mediated by inhibition of cell viability, colony fomation, invasion and promoting cell apoptosis, which may be achieved by suppressing HIF-1α levels. This study suggests 2-ME as a potential drug for bladder cancer therapy.",2017
29412690,Platelet procoagulant phenotype is modulated by a p38-MK2 axis that regulates RTN4/Nogo proximal to the endoplasmic reticulum: utility of pathway analysis.,"Upon encountering physiological cues associated with damaged or inflamed endothelium, blood platelets set forth intracellular responses to ultimately support hemostatic plug formation and vascular repair. To gain insights into the molecular events underlying platelet function, we used a combination of interactome, pathway analysis, and other systems biology tools to analyze associations among proteins functionally modified by reversible phosphorylation upon platelet activation. While an interaction analysis mapped out a relative organization of intracellular mediators in platelet signaling, pathway analysis revealed directional signaling relations around protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) associated with platelet cytoskeletal dynamics, inflammatory responses, and hemostatic function. Pathway and causality analysis further suggested that platelets activate a specific p38-MK2 axis to phosphorylate RTN4 (reticulon-4, also known as Nogo), a Bcl-xl sequestration protein and critical regulator of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) physiology. In vitro, we find that platelets drive a p38-MK2-RTN4-Bcl-xl pathway associated with the regulation of the ER and platelet phosphatidylserine exposure. Together, our results support the use of pathway tools in the analysis of omics data sets as a means to help generate novel, mechanistic, and testable hypotheses for platelet studies while uncovering RTN4 as a putative regulator of platelet cell physiological responses.",2018
29396485,hnRNP A1/A2 and Sam68 collaborate with SRSF10 to control the alternative splicing response to oxaliplatin-mediated DNA damage.,"Little is known about how RNA binding proteins cooperate to control splicing, and how stress pathways reconfigure these assemblies to alter splice site selection. We have shown previously that SRSF10 plays an important role in the Bcl-x splicing response to DNA damage elicited by oxaliplatin in 293 cells. Here, RNA affinity assays using a portion of the Bcl-x transcript required for this response led to the recovery of the SRSF10-interacting protein 14-3-3ε and the Sam68-interacting protein hnRNP A1. Although SRSF10, 14-3-3ε, hnRNP A1/A2 and Sam68 do not make major contributions to the regulation of Bcl-x splicing under normal growth conditions, upon DNA damage they become important to activate the 5' splice site of pro-apoptotic Bcl-xS. Our results indicate that DNA damage reconfigures the binding and activity of several regulatory RNA binding proteins on the Bcl-x pre-mRNA. Moreover, SRSF10, hnRNP A1/A2 and Sam68 collaborate to drive the DNA damage-induced splicing response of several transcripts that produce components implicated in apoptosis, cell-cycle control and DNA repair. Our study reveals how the circuitry of splicing factors is rewired to produce partnerships that coordinate alternative splicing across processes crucial for cell fate.",2018
29391599,Targeting PLK1 overcomes T-DM1 resistance via CDK1-dependent phosphorylation and inactivation of Bcl-2/xL in HER2-positive breast cancer.,"Trastuzumab-refractory, HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2)-positive breast cancer is commonly treated with trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), an antibody-drug conjugate of trastuzumab and the microtubule-targeting agent, DM1. However, drug response reduces greatly over time due to acquisition of resistance whose molecular mechanisms are mostly unknown. Here, we uncovered a novel mechanism of resistance against T-DM1 by combining whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq), proteomics and a targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA) sensitization screen for molecular level analysis of acquired and de novo T-DM1-resistant models of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. We identified Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a mitotic kinase, as a resistance mediator whose genomic as well as pharmacological inhibition restored drug sensitivity. Both acquired and de novo resistant models exhibited synergistic growth inhibition upon combination of T-DM1 with a selective PLK1 inhibitor, volasertib, at a wide concentration range of the two drugs. Mechanistically, T-DM1 sensitization upon PLK1 inhibition with volasertib was initiated by a spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC)-dependent mitotic arrest, leading to caspase activation, followed by DNA damage through CDK1-dependent phosphorylation and inactivation of Bcl-2/xL. Furthermore, we showed that Ser70 phosphorylation of Bcl-2 directly regulates apoptosis by disrupting the binding to and sequestration of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim. Importantly, T-DM1 resistance signature or PLK1 expression correlated with cell cycle progression and DNA repair, and predicted a lower sensitivity to taxane/trastuzumab combination in HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Finally, volasertib in combination with T-DM1 greatly synergized in models of T-DM1 resistance in terms of growth inhibition both in three dimensional (3D) cell culture and in vivo. Altogether, our results provide promising pre-clinical evidence for potential testing of T-DM1/volasertib combination in T-DM1 refractory HER2-positive breast cancer patients for whom there is currently no treatment available.",2018
29380241,"Novel ethanocycloheptono [3,4,5-kl]benzo[a]xanthene induces apoptosis in BEL-7402 cells.","A novel polycyclic bridged-ring xanthene 2 was synthesized by nucleophilic substitution followed by Michael addition reaction between parent dibenzoxanthene 1 and acetylacetone. The structure of compound 2 was also confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. We studied the binding activity of this compound with bovine serum albumin (BSA) by fluorescent and UV-visible spectra. The results showed that compound had strong binding ability with BSA. Cell viability in five tumor cell lines was studied by MTT assay. The cytotoxic effect of bridged-ring xanthene 2 against BEL-7402 cells was examined by morphological analyses and biochemical assays. Significant nuclear damages of BEL-7402 cells were observed after cells were treated with compound in a comet assay. The compound also caused DNA damage and S phase arrest in BEL-7402 cells. The efficient induction of apoptosis by the compound was confirmed by flow cytometry. Additionally, the characteristic nuclear and morphological changes during apoptotic cell death were investigated by fluorescent microscopy. The compound 2 enhanced the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential. Western blot assay indicated that the compound can active caspase-3, caspase-7, down-regulate the level of Bcl-2, Bcl-x, and up-regulate the level of pro-apoptosis protein Bax. The compound 2 induces apoptosis of BEL-7402 cells through a ROS-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction pathway.",2018
29358700,BIM and NOXA are mitochondrial effectors of TAF6δ-driven apoptosis.,"TAF6δ is a pro-apoptotic splice variant of the RNA polymerase II general transcription factor, TAF6, that can dictate life vs. death decisions in animal cells. TAF6δ stands out from classical pro-apoptotic proteins because it is encoded by a gene that is essential at the cellular level, and because it functions as a component of the basal transcription machinery. TAF6δ has been shown to modulate the transcriptome landscape, but it is not known if changes in gene expression trigger apoptosis nor which TAF6δ-regulated genes contribute to cell death. Here we used microarrays to interrogate the genome-wide impact of TAF6δ on transcriptome dynamics at temporal resolution. The results revealed changes in pro-apoptotic BH3-only mitochondrial genes that correlate tightly with the onset of cell death. These results prompted us to test and validate a role for the mitochondrial pathway by showing that TAF6δ expression causes cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm. To further dissect the mechanism by which TAF6δ drives apoptosis, we pinpointed BIM and NOXA as candidate effectors. siRNA experiments showed that both BIM and NOXA contribute to TAF6δ-dependent cell death. Our results identify mitochondrial effectors of TAF6δ-driven apoptosis, thereby providing the first of mechanistic framework underlying the atypical TAF6δ apoptotic pathway's capacity to intersect with the classically defined apoptotic machinery to trigger cell death.",2018

In this study, we sought to better understand the mechanisms of apoptotic regulation in normal and activated B cells. Using intracellular BH3 profiling, we defined the Bcl2 dependency of B cell subsets from human peripheral blood and tonsillar lymphoid tissue as well as mitogen-activated B cells. We found that naive and memory B cells were BCL-2-dependent, whereas germinal center B cells were MCL-1-dependent and plasma cells were BCL-X",2018
29353044,BMP4 signaling in NPCs upregulates Bcl-xL to promote their survival in the presence of FGF-2.,"We previously reported that BMP4 does not promote proliferation or differentiation of CD44-positive astrocyte precursor cells (APCs) but greatly promotes their survival in the presence of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). In this study, we examined if BMP4 acts as a survival factor also for neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) isolated from ganglionic eminence of neonatal mouse brain. We found BMP4 promotes survival but not proliferation or differentiation of these cells, just as in the case for CD44-positive APCs. Microarray analysis revealed some candidate molecules in the signaling pathway downstream of BMP4. Among them, we focused on Id1 (inhibitor of DNA-binding 1) and Bcl-xL in this study. Expression of both genes was promoted in the presence of BMP4, and this promotion was reduced by dorsomorphin, an inhibitor of BMP4 signaling. Furthermore, cytochrome c release from mitochondria was significantly reduced in the presence of BMP4, suggesting up-regulation of Bcl-xL activity by BMP4. Id1 siRNA reduced the expression of Bcl-xL, and negated survival promoting effect of BMP4. These data suggest that BMP4 promotes survival of NPCs by enhancing the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-xL via BMP4-Smad1/5/8-Id1 signaling.",2018
29343814,Intrinsic apoptotic pathway activation increases response to anti-estrogens in luminal breast cancers.,"Estrogen receptor-α positive (ERα+) breast cancer accounts for approximately 70-80% of the nearly 25,0000 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed in the US each year. Endocrine-targeted therapies (those that block ERα activity) serve as the first line of treatment in most cases. Despite the proven benefit of endocrine therapies, however, ERα+ breast tumors can develop resistance to endocrine therapy, causing disease progression or relapse, particularly in the metastatic setting. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins enhance breast tumor cell survival, often promoting resistance to targeted therapies, including endocrine therapies. Herein, we investigated whether blockade of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins could sensitize luminal breast cancers to anti-estrogen treatment. We used long-term estrogen deprivation (LTED) of human ERα+ breast cancer cell lines, an established model of sustained treatment with and acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitors (AIs), in combination with Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition (ABT-263), finding that ABT-263 induced only limited tumor cell killing in LTED-selected cells in culture and in vivo. Interestingly, expression and activity of the Bcl-2-related factor Mcl-1 was increased in LTED cells. Genetic Mcl-1 ablation induced apoptosis in LTED-selected cells, and potently increased their sensitivity to ABT-263. Increased expression and activity of Mcl-1 was similarly seen in clinical breast tumor specimens treated with AI + the selective estrogen receptor downregulator fulvestrant. Delivery of Mcl-1 siRNA loaded into polymeric nanoparticles (MCL1 si-NPs) decreased Mcl-1 expression in LTED-selected and fulvestrant-treated cells, increasing tumor cell death and blocking tumor cell growth. These findings suggest that Mcl-1 upregulation in response to anti-estrogen treatment enhances tumor cell survival, decreasing response to therapeutic treatments. Therefore, strategies blocking Mcl-1 expression or activity used in combination with endocrine therapies would enhance tumor cell death.",2018
29339775,Anti-apoptotic A1 is not essential for lymphoma development in Eµ-Myc mice but helps sustain transplanted Eµ-Myc tumour cells.,"The transcription factor c-MYC regulates a multiplicity of genes involved in cellular growth, proliferation, metabolism and DNA damage response and its overexpression is a hallmark of many tumours. Since MYC promotes apoptosis under conditions of stress, such as limited availability of nutrients or cytokines, MYC-driven cells are very much dependent on signals that inhibit cell death. Stress signals trigger apoptosis via the pathway regulated by opposing fractions of the BCL-2 protein family and previous genetic studies have shown that the development of B lymphoid tumours in Eµ-Myc mice is critically dependent on expression of pro-survival BCL-2 relatives MCL-1, BCL-W and, to a lesser extent, BCL-X",2018
29330927,Defined Serum-Free Medium for Bioreactor Culture of an Immortalized Human Erythroblast Cell Line.,"Anticipated shortages in donated blood supply have prompted investigation of alternative approaches for in vitro production of red blood cells (RBCs), such as expansion of conditional immortalization erythroid progenitors. However, there is a bioprocessing challenge wherein factors promoting maximal cell expansion and growth-limiting inhibitory factors are yet to be investigated. The authors use an erythroblast cell line (ImEry) derived from immortalizing CD71+CD235a+ erythroblast from adult peripheral blood for optimization of expansion culture conditions. Design of experiments (DOE) is used in media formulation to explore relationships and interactive effects between factors which affect cell expansion. Our in-house optimized medium formulation produced significantly higher cell densities (3.62 ± 0.055) × 10",2018

29321496,Genistein promotes ionizing radiation-induced cell death by reducing cytoplasmic Bcl-xL levels in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Genistein (GEN) has been previously reported to enhance the radiosensitivity of cancer cells; however, the detailed mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report that GEN treatment inhibits the cytoplasmic distribution of Bcl-xL and increases nuclear Bcl-xL in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Interestingly, our in vitro data show that ionizing radiation IR treatment significantly increases IR-induced DNA damage and apoptosis in a low cytoplasmic Bcl-xL NSCLC cell line compared to that of high cytoplasmic Bcl-xL cell lines. In addition, clinical data also show that the level of cytoplasmic Bcl-xL was negatively associated with radiosensitivity in NSCLC. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GEN treatment enhanced the radiosensitivity of NSCLC cells partially due to increases in Beclin-1-mediated autophagy by promoting the dissociation of Bcl-xL and Beclin-1. Taken together, these findings suggest that GEN can significantly enhance radiosensitivity by increasing apoptosis and autophagy due to inhibition of cytoplasmic Bcl-xL distribution and the interaction of Bcl-xL and Beclin-1 in NSCLC cells, respectively.",2018
29304536,Defibrotide Stimulates Angiogenesis and Protects Endothelial Cells from Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Apoptosis via Upregulation of AKT/Bcl-xL.,"Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome is a life-threatening complication that can occur after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Defibrotide (DF) has been approved for the treatment of individuals with severe sinusoidal obstruction syndrome following haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the European Union and the United States. However, the precise mechanisms by which DF protects endothelial cells remain to be elucidated. In this study, we found that DF stimulated angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo as assessed by vascular tube formation, scratch-wound repair and Matrigel plug assays. These effects were associated with an activation of pro-survival signalling pathways, including AKT (protein kinase B), ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinases) and p38. More importantly, DF alleviated calcineurin inhibitor-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells in parallel with upregulation of anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xL), which was mediated by AKT (protein kinase B). Notably, these effects were abrogated when Bcl-xL was depleted by small interfering RNA (ribonucleic acid). In addition, DF counteracted calcineurin inhibitor-induced activation of nuclear factor-κB and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) signalling and production of cytokines in vascular endothelial cell-derived EA.hy926 cells. Taken together, DF has pro-angiogenic, anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects on endothelial cells. DF is a potentially useful agent to prevent the development of, and treat individuals with, endothelial cell injury-related complications after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",2018

29254294,Autophagy-related gene expression in colorectal cancer patients.,"There is evidence that autophagy can play a dual role in tumor cells  as a tumor suppressor, and a process involved in tumor cell survival. The aim of this work was to assess the expression of the genes engaged in the autophagy process in biopsies taken from the colon, confirmed as adenocarcinoma, and normal tissue and to relate them to the clinical stage of the tumor. A total of 20 pairs of surgically removed tumors and healthy (marginal) tissue samples from colorectal cancer patients at clinical stages (CS) I-IV were analyzed. Gene expression profile analysis was performed using HG-U133A microarrays. Differentially expressed genes were identified, using the PL-Grid Infrastructure. Only for CSI, there were two specific genes: FOXO1 and BNIP1; further in CSII  LAMP2, MET and BCL2L, in CSIII  HIF1A and 2 ID mRNAs for HGF and 18 genes were specific for CSIV in comparison to controls. PINK1 is the only gene that differentiates all transcriptome groups from controls. Furthermore, examination of the expression of genes associated with the autophagy process may allow for better knowledge and understanding of the processes occurring during the development of colon cancer. The presented genes may be used as prognostic markers of clinical stages of colorectal cancer, contributing to the development of new lines of therapy focused on reducing metastasis of the primary tumor.",2017

We demonstrate that fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation driven by matrix stiffness increases the mitochondrial priming (proximity to the apoptotic threshold) of these activated cells. Mitochondria in activated myofibroblasts, but not quiescent fibroblasts, are primed by death signals such as the proapoptotic BH3-only protein BIM, which creates a requirement for tonic expression of the antiapoptotic protein BCL-X",2017
29200207,Human antibody-based chemically induced dimerizers for cell therapeutic applications.,"Chemically induced dimerizers (CIDs) have emerged as one of the most powerful tools for artificially regulating signaling pathways in cells; however, currently available CID systems lack the properties desired for use in regulating cellular therapies. Here, we report the development of human antibody-based chemically induced dimerizers (AbCIDs) from known small-molecule-protein complexes by selecting for synthetic antibodies that recognize the chemical epitope created by the bound small molecule. We demonstrate this concept by generating three antibodies that are highly selective for the BCL-xL-ABT-737 complex compared to BCL-xL alone. We show the potential of AbCIDs for application in regulating human cell therapies by using them to induce CRISPRa-mediated gene expression and to regulate CAR T-cell activation. We believe that the AbCIDs generated in this study will find application in regulating cell therapies and that the general method of AbCID development may lead to the creation of many new and orthogonal CIDs.",2018
29193574,Norcantharidin induce apoptosis in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma through caspase and mitochondrial pathway.,"While Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is uncommon in western countries, it is endemic in Southeast Asia and Southern China. Previous study of norcantharidin (NCTD), isolated from blister beetles, has proved its anticancer effect on various tumors. However, the effect of NCTD in NPC has never been studied. The purpose of this study is to inspect the suppression activity of NCTD on NPC, along with the underlying mechanism. NPC cell line NPC-BM was treated with NCTD. NCTD remarkably inhibited proliferation and induce apoptosis in NPC-BM cell. Activation of caspase-3, -8, -9 was observed through western blotting. The expression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL was significantly reduced, but expression of proapoptotic protein Bak was increased after treatment of NCTD. The cytotoxic effect of NCTD on NPC-BM cell is mainly due to apoptosis, mediated by caspase and mitochondrial pathway. These results suggested that NCTD could be a potential anticancer agent for NPC.",2018
29193479,BCL-XL binds and antagonizes RASSF6 tumor suppressor to suppress p53 expression.,"RASSF6, a member of the tumor suppressor Ras-association domain family proteins, induces apoptosis in the caspase-dependent and caspase-independent manners. RASSF6 interacts with MDM2 and stabilizes p53. BCL-XL is a prosurvival member of BCL-2 family proteins. BCL-XL directly inhibits proapoptotic BAX and BAK. BCL-XL also traps tBID, a proapoptotic activator BH3-only protein, and sequesters p53. In addition, BCL-XL regulates the mitochondrial membrane permeability via voltage-dependent anion channel. In these manners, BCL-XL plays an antiapoptotic role. We report the interaction of BCL-XL with RASSF6. BCL-XL inhibits the interaction between RASSF6 and MDM2 and suppresses p53 expression. Consequently, BCL-XL antagonizes RASSF6-mediated apoptosis. Thus, the inhibition of RASSF6-mediated apoptosis also underlies the prosurvival role of BCL-XL.",2017

29156002,Specific G-quadruplex ligands modulate the alternative splicing of Bcl-X.,"Sequences with the potential to form RNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) are common in mammalian introns, especially in the proximity of the 5' splice site (5'SS). However, the difficulty of demonstrating that G4s form in pre-mRNA in functional conditions has meant that little is known about their effects or mechanisms of action. We have shown previously that two G4s form in Bcl-X pre-mRNA, one close to each of the two alternative 5'SS. If these G4s affect splicing but are in competition with other RNA structures or RNA binding proteins, then ligands that stabilize them would increase the proportion of Bcl-X pre-mRNA molecules in which either or both G4s had formed, shifting Bcl-X splicing. We show here that a restricted set of G4 ligands do affect splicing, that their activity and specificity are strongly dependent on their structures and that they act independently at the two splice sites. One of the ligands, the ellipticine GQC-05, antagonizes the major 5'SS that expresses the anti-apoptotic isoform of Bcl-X and activates the alternative 5'SS that expresses a pro-apoptotic isoform. We propose mechanisms that would account for these see-saw effects and suggest that these effects contribute to the ability of GQC-05 to induce apoptosis.",2018
29155028,Chitosan oligosaccharides with degree of polymerization 2-6 induces apoptosis in human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells.,"Colon cancer is the third most common cancer, and yet there is a lack of effective therapeutic method with low side effects. Chitosan oligosaccharides (COS) is derived from chitosan after chitin deacetylation, and attracts more interests due to smaller molecular weight and soluble property. Previously, COS, mainly absorbed through intestinal epithelia, has been reported to exhibit many bioactivities, especially its anti-tumor effect. Recent references pay little attention to molecular weight distribution which is crucial for understanding its biological behavior. Here, we studied reducing sugar content and degree of polymerization (DP) of COS. 86.73% reducing sugar exists in COS sample and the content of chitosan fractions with 2-6 is 85.8%. COS suppressed the growth of HCT116 cells in vitro and in vivo, and the inhibition rate of tumor weight in vivo was high up to 58.6%. Moreover, the morphology observation, flow cytometry analysis and mRNA expression were applied to study the apoptosis related mechanism. COS treatment promoted mitosis, late stage apoptosis and S cell cycle arrest in HCT116 cells, and enhanced the mRNA expression of BAK and reduce BCL-2 and BCL-x",2018

29109414,Involvement of autophagy in the outcome of mitotic catastrophe.,"Evading cell death is a major driving force for tumor progression that is one of the main problems in current cancer research. Mitotic catastrophe (MC) represents attractive platform compromising tumor resistance to current therapeutic modalities. MC appeared as onco-suppressive mechanism and is defined as a stage driving the cell to an irreversible destiny, i.e. cell death via apoptosis or necrosis. Our study highlights that MC induction in colorectal carcinoma cell lines ultimately leads to the autophagy followed by apoptosis. We show that autophagy suppression in Atg 13 knockout non-small cell lung carcinoma cells lead to the dramatic decrease of MC rate. Furthermore, mitochondria-linked anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL play a crucial role in the duration of MC and a cross-talk between autophagy and apoptosis. Thus, the suppression of apoptosis by overexpression of Mcl-1 or Bcl-xL affected MC and lead to a significant induction of autophagy in HCT116 wt and HCT116 14-3-3σ",2017

However, their interactions still remain unclear. We investigated here whether cytotoxic activity of genistein was enhanced by equol, using estrogen receptor positive MCF-7, HER2-positive SK-BR-3, and triple-negative MDA-MB-468 cell lines. Although cytotoxicity of genistein did not significantly differ between three subtypes of breast cancer cells, cytotoxic activities of genistein were significantly enhanced in combination with 50 μM equol in MCF-7 cells, but not in SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-468 cells. In fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses, MCF-7 cells were arrested at the G2/M by genistein but at G1/S by equol. Combination treatment arrested cells at G2/M but abolished equol-induced G1 block, indicating an antagonistic activity of genistein against equol in cell-cycle progression. Although apoptosis was not so evident with genistein alone, the combination made a drastic induction of apoptosis, accompanied by the increase of Bax/Bcl-xL expression ratio, without affecting the activities of Akt and mTOR. Taken together, these data suggest that enhancement of genistein activity by equol would be mainly mediated by augmented induction of apoptosis rather than arrest or delay of the cell cycle.",2017
29083324,Protein kinase A determines platelet life span and survival by regulating apoptosis.,"Apoptosis delimits platelet life span in the circulation and leads to storage lesion, which severely limits the shelf life of stored platelets. Moreover, accumulating evidence indicates that platelet apoptosis provoked by various pathological stimuli results in thrombocytopenia in many common diseases. However, little is known about how platelet apoptosis is initiated or regulated. Here, we show that PKA activity is markedly reduced in platelets aged in vitro, stored platelets, and platelets from patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), diabetes, and bacterial infections. Inhibition or genetic ablation of PKA provoked intrinsic programmed platelet apoptosis in vitro and rapid platelet clearance in vivo. PKA inhibition resulted in dephosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein BAD at Ser155, resulting in sequestration of prosurvival protein BCL-XL in mitochondria and subsequent apoptosis. Notably, PKA activation protected platelets from apoptosis induced by storage or pathological stimuli and elevated peripheral platelet levels in normal mice and in a murine model of ITP. Therefore, these findings identify PKA as a homeostatic regulator of platelet apoptosis that determines platelet life span and survival. Furthermore, these results suggest that regulation of PKA activity represents a promising strategy for extending platelet shelf life and has profound implications for the treatment of platelet number-related diseases and disorders.",2017

Here we found that an extract of Lepidium latifolium, a cruciferous plant native to southern Europe, Mediterranean countries and Asia, showed in vitro cytotoxic activity, inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis, in a variety of human tumor cells, and the plant juice showed in vivo antitumor activity in a HT-29 human colon cancer xenograft mouse model. The epithionitrile 1-cyano-2,3-epithiopropane (CETP) was identified as the major active cancer cell-killing principle of L. latifolium. Synthetic and plant-derived CETP displayed similar proapoptotic activities as assessed by biochemical and morphological analyses. Analysis of the antiproliferative capacity of CETP on a wide number of cancer cell lines from the NCI-60 cell line panel followed by COMPARE analysis, showed an activity profile different from known anticancer agents. Flow cytometry and biochemical analyses revealed that CETP-induced apoptosis involved mitochondria, as assessed by loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and generation of reactive oxygen species, while overexpression of Bcl-X",2018

Sprague‑Dawley rats were used for the construction of isoflurane‑treated models. The Morris water maze test was used to evaluate the effects of isoflurane on rats regarding the following para-meters: Swimming speed, escape latency and time in original quadrant. Influences of isoflurane on neuron apoptosis and miR‑448 expression in rat hippocampus tissue were analyzed by flow cytometry and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Furthermore, the effects of miR‑448 on the expression of cell apoptosis‑associated proteins were investigated by flow cytometry. The results demonstrated that isoflurane treatment induced higher escape latency and lower time spent in original quadrant compared with the control rats. In addition, isoflurane treatment induced neuron apoptosis and miR‑448 was highly expressed in the hippocampal tissue of isoflurane‑treated rats. Furthermore, Bcl‑x was significantly downregulated while caspase‑3 expression was upregulated by an miR‑448 inhibitor. Combined the results of the current study indicate that miR‑448 knockdown may have pivotal roles in improving isoflurane-induced learning and memory impairment via suppressing neuron apoptosis.",2017

We hypothesized that inhibition of the MIP-1α autocrine loop may enhance the cytotoxic effect of anticancer drugs in MM cell lines. In the present study, an MIP-1α neutralizing antibody suppressed cell proliferation and enhanced the cytotoxic effect of melphalan or bortezomib on MM cells. In addition, melphalan resistance cells (RPMI8226/L-PAM and HS-sultan/L-PAM cells) secreted MIP-1α and neutralizing antibody of MIP-1α partially overcame melphalan resistance. Moreover, combination treatment with MIP-1α neutralizing antibody and melphalan or bortezomib inhibited extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), Akt, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Survivin expression, and upregulated the expression of Bim and cleaved Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Treatment of IM9 cells with MIP-1α siRNA suppressed the activation of ERK1/2, Akt, and mTOR, and enhanced the cytotoxic effect of melphalan and bortezomib. These results indicate that MIP-1α neutralizing antibodies or MIP-1α siRNA enhance the cytotoxic effect of melphalan and bortezomib by suppressing the chemokine receptor/ERK and chemokine receptor/Akt/mTOR pathways. The inhibition of MIP-1α may thus provide a new therapeutic approach to control tumor progression and bone destruction in patients with MM.",2018

29031805,Aptamer-targeted delivery of Bcl-xL shRNA using alkyl modified PAMAM dendrimers into lung cancer cells.,"RNAi-based gene therapy has been recently considered as a promising approach against cancer. Targeted delivery of drug, gene or therapeutic RNAi-based systems to tumor cells is one of the important issues in order to reduce side effects on normal cells. Several strategies have been developed to improve the safety and selectivity of cancer treatments including antibodies, peptides and recently aptamers with various attractive characteristics including higher target specificity, affinity and reduced toxicity. Here we described a novel targeted delivery platform comprising modified PAMAM with 10-bromodecanoic acid (10C) and 10C-PEG for improvement of transfection efficiency, AS1411 aptamer for targeting nucleolin ligand on target cancer cells and shRNA plasmid for specific knockdown of Bcl-xL protein. Modified vector could significantly improve the transfection efficiency even after covalent or non-covalent aptamer binding compared to the non-targeted vector in A549 cells. The results of gene silencing and apoptosis assay indicated that our targeted shRNA delivery system could efficiently down-regulate the Bcl-xL expression up to 25% and induce 14% late apoptosis in target cancer cells with strong cell selectivity. This study proposed a novel targeted non-viral system for shRNA-mediated gene-silencing in cancer cells.",2017
29025092,Heat stress induces autophagy in pig ovaries during follicular development.,"Hyperthermia or heat stress (HS) occurs when heat dissipation mechanisms are overwhelmed by external and internal heat production. Hyperthermia negatively affects reproduction and potentially compromises oocyte integrity and reduces developmental competence of ensuing embryos. Autophagy is the process by which cells recycle energy through the reutilization of cellular components and is activated by a variety of stressors. Study objectives were to characterize autophagy-related proteins in the ovary following cyclical HS during the follicular phase. Twelve gilts were synchronized and subjected to cyclical HS (n = 6) or thermal neutral (n = 6) conditions for 5 days during the follicular phase. Ovarian protein abundance of Beclin 1 and microtubule associated protein light chain 3 beta II were each elevated as a result of HS (P = 0.001 and 0.003, respectively). The abundance of the autophagy related (ATG)12-ATG5 complex was decreased as a result of HS (P = 0.002). Regulation of autophagy and apoptosis occurs in tight coordination, and B-cell lymphoma (BCL)2 and BCL2L1 are involved in regulating both processes. BCL2L1 protein abundance, as detected via immunofluorescence, was increased in both the oocyte (∼1.6-fold; P < 0.01) and granulosa cells of primary follicles (∼1.4-fold P < 0.05) of HS ovaries. These results suggest that ovarian autophagy induction occurs in response to HS during the follicular phase, and that HS increases anti-apoptotic signaling in oocytes and early follicles. These data contribute to the biological understanding of how HS acts as an environmental stress to affect follicular development and negatively impact reproduction.",2017

28982759,Dynein light chain 1 induces assembly of large Bim complexes on mitochondria that stabilize Mcl-1 and regulate apoptosis.,"The Bcl-2 family protein Bim triggers mitochondrial apoptosis. Bim is expressed in nonapoptotic cells at the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it is activated by largely unknown mechanisms. We found that Bim is regulated by formation of large protein complexes containing dynein light chain 1 (DLC1). Bim rapidly inserted into cardiolipin-containing membranes in vitro and recruited DLC1 to the membrane. Bim binding to DLC1 induced the formation of large Bim complexes on lipid vesicles, on isolated mitochondria, and in intact cells. Native gel electrophoresis and gel filtration showed Bim-containing mitochondrial complexes of several hundred kilodaltons in all cells tested. Bim unable to form complexes was consistently more active than complexed Bim, which correlated with its substantially reduced binding to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. At endogenous levels, Bim surprisingly bound only anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 but not Bcl-2 or Bcl-X",2017

28972012,A critical epithelial survival axis regulated by MCL-1 maintains thymic function in mice.,"T-cell differentiation is governed by interactions with thymic epithelial cells (TECs) and defects in this process undermine immune function and tolerance. To uncover new strategies to restore thymic function and adaptive immunity in immunodeficiency, we sought to determine the molecular mechanisms that control life and death decisions in TECs. Guided by gene expression profiling, we created mouse models that specifically deleted prosurvival genes in TECs. We found that although BCL-2 and BCL-XL were dispensable for TEC homeostasis, MCL-1 deficiency impacted on TECs as early as embryonic day 15.5, resulting in early thymic atrophy and T-cell lymphopenia, with near complete loss of thymic tissue by 2 months of age. MCL-1 was not necessary for TEC differentiation but was continually required for the survival of mature cortical and medullary TECs and the maintenance of thymic architecture. A screen of TEC trophic factors in organ cultures showed that epidermal growth factor upregulated MCL-1 via MAPK/ERK kinase activity, providing a molecular mechanism for the support of TEC survival. This signaling axis governing TEC survival and thymic function represents a new target for strategies for thymic protection and regeneration.",2017

28938399,Gonadotropin-Dependent Neuregulin-1 Signaling Regulates Female Rat Ovarian Granulosa Cell Survival.,"Mammalian ovarian follicular development and maturation of an oocyte competent to be fertilized and develop into an embryo depends on tightly regulated, spatiotemporally orchestrated crosstalk among cell death, survival, and differentiation signals through extra- and intraovarian signals, as well as on a permissive ovarian follicular microenvironment. Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) is a member of the epidermal growth factor-like factor family that mediates its effects by binding to a member of the erythroblastoma (ErbB) family. Our experimental results suggest gonadotropins promote differential expression of NRG1 and erbB receptors in granulosa cells (GCs), and NRG1 in theca cells during follicular development, and promote NRG1 secretions in the follicular fluid (FF) of rat ovaries. During the estrous cycle of rat, NRG1 and erbB receptors are differentially expressed in GCs and correlate positively with serum gonadotropins and steroid hormones. Moreover, in vitro experimental studies suggest that the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine (STS) causes the physical destruction of GCs by the activation of caspase-3. Exogenous NRG1 treatment of GCs delayed onset of STS-induced apoptosis and inhibited cleaved caspase-3 expressions. Moreover, exogenous NRG1 treatment of GCs alters STS-induced death by maintaining the expression of ErbB2, ErbB3, pAkt, Bcl2, and BclxL proteins. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that NRG1 is gonadotropin dependent, differentially regulated in GCs and theca cells, and secreted in ovarian FF as an intracellular survival factor that may govern follicular maturation.",2017
28937296,Comparison of E-cadherin with STAT3 and apoptosis regulators: Bak and Bcl-xL in endometrioid adenocarcinomas of different ER-alpha immunoprofile.,"E-cadherin is a factor of good prognosis in endometrioid adenocarcinomas, while STAT3 is an oncogenic driver of carcinogenesis. E-cadherin, Bak, Bcl-xL and STAT3 were immunohistochemically detected in 78 human endometrioid adenocarcinomas. E-cadherin correlated with STAT3 (p <. 001, r = 0.537) as well as Bak (p = .005, r = 0.314) and Bcl-xL (p = .002, r = 0.340) in the whole study group. In G2 tumors, E-cadherin associated with Bak (p = .021, r = 0.319), Bcl-xL (p = .026, r = 0.309) and STAT3 (p <.001, r = 0.513) but not in G3 adenocarcinomas. E-cadherin correlated with Bak and Bcl-xL in both G1- and estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors with significant relation of E-cadherin and STAT3 in G1- and ER-negative tumors. Antigrowth synergy of expression was preserved for antiapoptotic Bak and proliferation-suppressing E-cadherin in IA adenocarcinomas (p = .031, r = 0.342) with no significance between Bak and E-cadherin or STAT3 and emerging correlation between E-cadherin and Bcl-xL in IB + II tumors instead (p = .003, r = 0.472). E-cadherin correlated with Bak and Bcl-xL in ER-positive adenocarcinomas (p =  .002, r = 0.382 and p <.001, r = 0.439, respectively) but not in ER-negative tumors. In conclusion, expression deregulation of studied proteins is reflected in selective loss of correlation between suppressors of tumor growth (E-cadherin and Bak) presumably due to progressing impairment of growth-inhibitory properties of clone of neoplastic cells within higher staging and poorer differentiation.",2018
28903561,Enhanced Sampling of Intrinsic Structural Heterogeneity of the BH3-Only Protein Binding Interface of Bcl-xL.,"Antiapoptotic Bcl-xL plays central roles in regulating programed cell death. Partial unfolding of Bcl-xL has been observed at the interface upon specific binding to the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein PUMA, which in turn disrupts the interaction of Bcl-xL with tumor suppressor p53 and promotes apoptosis. Previous analysis of existing Bcl-xL structures and atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have suggested that substantial intrinsic structure heterogeneity exists at the BH3-only protein binding interface of Bcl-xL to facilitate its conformational transitions upon binding. In this study, enhanced sampling is applied to further characterize the interfacial conformations of unbound Bcl-xL in explicit solvent. Extensive replica exchange with solute tempering (REST) simulations, with a total accumulated time of 16 μs, were able to cover much wider conformational spaces for the interfacial region of Bcl-xL. The resulting structural ensembles are much better converged, with local and long-range structural features that are highly consistent with existing NMR data. These simulations further demonstrate that the BH3-only protein binding interface of Bcl-xL is intrinsically disordered and samples many rapidly interconverting conformations. Intriguingly, all previously observed conformers are well represented in the unbound structure ensemble. Such intrinsic structural heterogeneity and flexibility may be critical for Bcl-xL to undergo partial unfolding induced by PUMA binding, and likely provide a robust basis that allows Bcl-xL to respond sensitively to binding of various ligands in cellular signaling and regulation.",2017
28895730,Rheostatic Control of Cas9-Mediated DNA Double Strand Break (DSB) Generation and Genome Editing.,"We recently reported two novel tools for precisely controlling and quantifying Cas9 activity: a chemically inducible Cas9 variant (ciCas9) that can be rapidly activated by small molecules and a ddPCR assay for time-resolved measurement of DNA double strand breaks (DSB-ddPCR). Here, we further demonstrate the potential of ciCas9 to function as a tunable rheostat for Cas9 function. We show that a new highly potent and selective small molecule activator paired with a more tightly regulated ciCas9 variant expands the range of accessible Cas9 activity levels. We subsequently demonstrate that ciCas9 activity levels can be dose-dependently tuned with a small molecule activator, facilitating rheostatic time-course experiments. These studies provide the first insight into how Cas9-mediated DSB levels correlate with overall editing efficiency. Thus, we demonstrate that ciCas9 and our DSB-ddPCR assay permit the time-resolved study of Cas9 DSB generation and genome editing kinetics at a wide range of Cas9 activity levels.",2018
28888620,The caspase-8/Bid/cytochrome c axis links signals from death receptors to mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production.,"Ligation of the death receptors for TNF-α, FasL, and TRAIL triggers two common pathways, caspase-dependent intrinsic apoptosis and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The apoptotic pathway is well characterized; however, a signaling linker between the death receptor and ROS production has not been clearly elucidated. Here, we found that death receptor-induced ROS generation was strongly inhibited by mitochondrial complex I and II inhibitors, but not by inhibitors of NADPH oxidase, lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase or xanthine oxidase, indicating that ROS are mostly generated by the impairment of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. ROS generation was accompanied by caspase-8 activation, Bid cleavage, and cytochrome c release; it was blocked in FADD- and caspase-8-deficient cells, as well as by caspase-8 knockdown and inhibitor. Moreover, Bid knockdown abrogated TNF-α- or TRAIL-induced ROS generation, whereas overexpression of truncated Bid (tBid) or knockdown of cytochrome c spontaneously elevated ROS production. In addition, p53-overexpressing cells accumulated intracellular ROS via cytochrome c release mediated by the BH3-only protein Noxa induction. In a cell-free reconstitution system, caspase-8-mediated Bid cleavage and recombinant tBid induced mitochondrial cytochrome c release and ROS generation, which were blocked by Bcl-xL and antioxidant enzymes. These data suggest that anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins play an important role in mitochondrial ROS generation by preventing cytochrome c release. These data provide evidence that the FADD/caspase-8/Bid/cytochrome c axis is a crucial linker between death receptors and mitochondria, where they play a role in ROS generation and apoptosis.",2017
28882984,Transient apoptosis inhibition in donor stem cells improves hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,"During hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, a substantial number of donor cells are lost because of apoptotic cell death. Transplantation-associated apoptosis is mediated mainly by the proapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins BIM and BMF, and their proapoptotic function is conserved between mouse and human stem and progenitor cells. Permanent inhibition of apoptosis in donor cells caused by the loss of these BH3-only proteins improves transplantation outcome, but recipients might be exposed to increased risk of lymphomagenesis or autoimmunity. Here, we address whether transient inhibition of apoptosis can serve as a safe but efficient alternative to improve the outcome of stem cell transplantation. We show that transient apoptosis inhibition by short-term overexpression of prosurvival BCL-XL, known to block BIM and BMF, is not only sufficient to increase the viability of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells during engraftment but also improves transplantation outcome without signs of adverse pathologies. Hence, this strategy represents a promising and novel therapeutic approach, particularly under conditions of limited donor stem cell availability.",2017
28875977,The life and death of immune cell types: the role of BCL-2 anti-apoptotic molecules.,"Targeting survival mechanisms of immune cells may provide an avenue for immune intervention to dampen unwanted responses (e.g. autoimmunity, immunopathology and transplant rejection) or enhance beneficial ones (e.g. immune deficiency, microbial defence and cancer immunotherapy). The selective survival mechanisms of the various immune cell types also avails the possibility of specific tailoring of such interventions. Here, we review the role of the BCL-2 anti-apoptotic family members (BCL-2, BCL-XL, BCL-W, MCL-1 and A1) on cell death/survival of the major immune cell types, for example, T, NK, B, dendritic cell (DC) lineages. There is both selectivity and redundancy among this family. Selectivity comes partly from the expression levels in each of the cell types. For example, plasmacytoid DC express abundant BCL-2 and are susceptible to BCL-2 antagonism or deficiency, whereas conventional DC express abundant A1 and are susceptible to A1 deficiency. There is, however, also functional redundancy; for example, overexpression of MCL-1 can override BCL-2 antagonism in plasmacytoid DC. Moreover, susceptibility to another anti-apoptotic family member can be unmasked, when one or other member is removed. These dual principles of selectivity and redundancy should guide the use of antagonists for manipulating immune cells.",2017
28866374,"1-Phenyl-1H-indole derivatives as a new class of Bcl-2/Mcl-1 dual inhibitors: Design, synthesis, and preliminary biological evaluation.","Bcl-2 proteins, such as B-cell lymphoma (Bcl-2) protein, myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) protein, has been implicated in the progression and survival of multiple tumor types and become a validated and attractive target for cancer therapy. In this work, a series of 1-phenyl-1H-indole derivatives has been designed and synthesized.

28808415,FOXO Signaling Pathways as Therapeutic Targets in Cancer.,"Many transcription factors play a key role in cellular differentiation and the delineation of cell phenotype. Transcription factors are regulated by phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation/deacetylation and interactions between two or more proteins controlling multiple signaling pathways. These pathways regulate different physiological processes and pathological events, such as cancer and other diseases. The Forkhead box O (FOXO) is one subfamily of the fork head transcription factor family with important roles in cell fate decisions and this subfamily is also suggested to play a pivotal functional role as a tumor suppressor in a wide range of cancers. During apoptosis, FOXOs are involved in mitochondria-dependent and -independent processes triggering the expression of death receptor ligands like Fas ligand, TNF apoptosis ligand and Bcl‑X",2017
28805353,The role of Melatonin receptor MTNR1A in the action of Melatonin on bovine granulosa cells.,"Granulosa cells (GCs) play an important role in ovarian follicle growth, development, and follicular atresia. In the present study, we investigated the effects of Melatonin on bovine GCs, and asked if MTNR1A was involved in their response to this indole hormone. Our results indicated that Melatonin inhibited GC apoptosis by up-regulating the expression of BCL2, BCL-XL, GPX4, and SOD1, and down-regulating the expression of BAX, CASP3, and TP53. Moreover, Melatonin modulated bovine GC function by decreasing the expression of INHA, INHBB, FSHR, and TGFBR3, and the abundance of Inhibin β and Activin B, while increasing the expression of LHR, INHBA, and secretion of progesterone by GCs. In contrast, knockdown of MTNR1A significantly increased the expression of BAX, CASP3, TP53, INHA, FSHR, and TGFBR3, as well as Inhibin β abundance, while decreasing the expression of BCL2, GPX4, SOD1, and LHR, and production of progesterone and estradiol; no effect was observed on the expression of BCL-XL, INHBA, or INHBB. These results suggest that Melatonin and MTNR1A play an important role in modulating bovine GC function by regulating cellular progression, apoptosis, hormones secretion, and reproduction-related genes. Furthermore, altered expression of MTNR1A could affect how bovine GCs respond to Melatonin.",2017
28791387,"Atelocollagen-mediated in vivo siRNA transfection in ovarian carcinoma is influenced by tumor site, siRNA target and administration route.","Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancies worldwide, and innate or acquired chemoresistance of ovarian cancer cells is the major cause of therapeutic failure. It has been demonstrated that the concomitant inhibition of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 anti-apoptotic activities is able to trigger apoptosis in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells. In this context, siRNA-mediated Bcl‑xL and Mcl-1 inhibition constitutes an appealing strategy by which to eliminate chemoresistant cancer cells. However, the safest and most efficient way to vectorize siRNAs in vivo is still under debate. In the present study, using in vivo bioluminescence imaging, we evaluated the interest of atelocollagen to vectorize siRNAs by intraperitoneal (i.p.) or intravenous (i.v.) administration in 2 xenografted ovarian cancer models (peritoneal carcinomatosis and subcutaneous tumors in nude mice). Whereas i.p. administration of atelocollagen-vectorized siRNA in the peritoneal carcinomatosis model did not induce any gene downregulation, a 70% transient downregulation of luciferase expression was achieved after i.v. injection of atelocollagen-vectorized siRNA in the subcutaneous (s.c.) model. However, the use of siRNA targeting Bcl-xL or Mcl-1 did not induce target-specific downregulation in vivo in nude mice. Our results therefore show that atelocollagen complex formulation, the administration route, tumor site and the identity of the siRNA target influence the efficiency of atelocollagen‑mediated siRNA delivery.",2017
28777484,5-Azacytidine specifically inhibits the NIH-3T3 PCD process induced by TNF-alpha and cycloheximide via affecting BCL-XL.,"DNA methylation plays a crucial role in lots of biological processes and cancer. 5-azacytidine (5-AC), a DNA methylation inhibitor, has been used as a potential chemotherapeutic agent for cancer. In this study, we used 5-AC treatment to investigate whether DNA methylation was involved in regulation of programmed cell death (PCD) in mouse embryo fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells which could undergo PCD after treatment with TNF-α and cycloheximide (CHX). The results showed that the genomic DNA of NIH-3T3 cells was hypermethylated during PCD induced by TNF-α and CHX, and 5-AC might prevent this PCD process. However, treatment with the other three DNA methylation inhibitors, 5-aza-deoxycytidine, 6-thioguanine and RG108, did not interfere with the NIH-3T3 cell PCD process. Additionally, knockdown of DNMT1 did not affect the apoptosis process. The present results and observations indicated that 5-AC specifically inhibited the NIH-3T3 apoptosis process via a genomic DNA methylation-independent pathway. During the TNF-α and CHX-inducing apoptosis process, the PCD related BCL-2 family proteins were significantly down-regulated. Furthermore, after the small interference RNA-mediated knockdown of BCL-XL, one of the BCL-2 family proteins, 5-AC did not inhibit the apoptosis process, suggesting that 5-AC inhibited the PCD process induced by TNF-α and CHX by affecting the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-XL.",2018
28768804,Synergistic action of the MCL-1 inhibitor S63845 with current therapies in preclinical models of triple-negative and HER2-amplified breast cancer.,"The development of BH3 mimetics, which antagonize prosurvival proteins of the BCL-2 family, represents a potential breakthrough in cancer therapy. Targeting the prosurvival member MCL-1 has been an area of intense interest because it is frequently deregulated in cancer. In breast cancer, MCL-1 is often amplified, and high expression predicts poor patient outcome. We tested the MCL-1 inhibitor S63845 in breast cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenografts with high expression of MCL-1. S63845 displayed synergistic activity with docetaxel in triple-negative breast cancer and with trastuzumab or lapatinib in HER2-amplified breast cancer. Using S63845-resistant cells combined with CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas9 (CRISPR-associated 9) technology, we identified deletion of BAK and up-regulation of prosurvival proteins as potential mechanisms that confer resistance to S63845 in breast cancer. Collectively, our findings provide a strong rationale for the clinical evaluation of MCL-1 inhibitors in breast cancer.",2017
28732245,Interleukin-4 receptor-targeted delivery of Bcl-xL siRNA sensitizes tumors to chemotherapy and inhibits tumor growth.,"IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) is commonly up-regulated on tumor cells, and interactions between the receptor and Interleukin-4 (IL-4) can induce the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, including Bcl-xL. This contributes to tumor cell survival and their resistance to chemotherapy. In this study, we exploited IL-4R-targeted delivery of Bcl-xL siRNA to IL-4R-expressing tumor cells in order to sensitize them to chemotherapy. To target IL-4R, an IL-4R-binding peptide, IL4RPep-1, was attached to branched polyethyleneimine-superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (BPEI-SPION). These nanoparticles were then complexed with Bcl-xL-targeting siRNA. IL-4R-targeted BPEI-SPION/Bcl-xL siRNA more efficiently reduced Bcl-xL gene expression and enhanced cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in MDA-MB231 breast tumor cells compared to untargeted BPEI-SPION/Bcl-xL siRNA. The siRNA was released from the complexes after 15 h of incubation at pH 5.5 and was stable in the complexes up to 72 h in the serum. The IL-4R-targeted BPEI-SPION/siRNA was internalized by cells through IL-4R, successfully escaped the endosomes, and was dispersed into the cytoplasm. Near-infrared fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that in vivo tumor homing and accumulation of IL-4R-targeted BPEI-SPION/siRNA were both higher than untargeted BPEI-SPION/siRNA. The IL-4R-targeted BPEI-SPION/Bcl-xL siRNA, in combination with doxorubicin, significantly inhibited tumor growth in mice compared to untargeted BPEI-SPION/Bcl-xL siRNA. These results suggest that the IL-4R-targeted delivery of Bcl-xL siRNA to IL-4R-expressing tumors can sensitize tumors to chemotherapy and enhance the efficacy of anti-tumor therapeutics.",2017

28709980,Downregulation of USP18 inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma cells by suppressing BCL2L1.,"Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18) is closely related with hepatitis B virus (HBV), which has been involved in tumourigenesis. However, there has been little research into the role of USP18 on the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), especially in HBV-related HCC. In present study, we found that USP18 expression was aberrantly elevated in HCC tissues than adjacent non-tumour tissues. Importantly, USP18 expression was higher in HBV-related HCC cell lines (HepG2.2.15 and Hep3B) than HBV-unrelated HCC cell lines. Furthermore, knockdown of USP18 significantly suppressed tumour cell proliferation in vitro and tumour growth in vivo, whereas overexpression of USP18 promoted HCC cells growth. Moreover, our experimental data revealed that USP18 silencing obviously blocked cell cycle at G1 phase and increased cell apoptosis. Finally, BCL2L1, a member of BCL2 family protein, was identified as a downstream gene of USP18. Mechanistically, we found that USP18 directly bind to BCL2L1 and positively regulated its expression in HCC cells. Overall, our results suggested that USP18 has a crucial role in regulating diverse aspects of the pathogenesis of HCC, indicating that it might be a potential therapeutic target.",2017
28692033,Spontaneous loss of B lineage transcription factors leads to pre-B leukemia in Ebf1,"Early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1) plays a central role in B-cell lineage specification and commitment. Loss of this critical transcription factor is strongly associated with high-risk, relapsed and therapy-resistant B-cell-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, especially in children. However, Ebf1 haploinsufficient mice exhibit a normal lifespan. To determine whether prolonged survival of B cells would enable tumorigenesis in Ebf1 haploinsufficient animals, we generated Ebf1",2017
28682312,The BH3-only proteins BIM and PUMA are not critical for the reticulocyte apoptosis caused by loss of the pro-survival protein BCL-XL.,"Anaemia is a major global health problem arising from diverse causes and for which improved therapeutic strategies are needed. Erythroid cells can undergo apoptotic cell death and loss of pro-survival BCL-XL is known to trigger apoptosis during late-stage erythroid development. However, the mechanism by which loss or pharmacological blockade of BCL-XL leads to erythroid cell apoptosis remains unclear. Here we sought to identify the precise stage of erythropoiesis that depends on BCL-XL. We also tested whether deficiency of BIM or PUMA, the two main pro-apoptotic antagonists of BCL-XL, could prevent reticulocyte death and anaemia caused by BCL-XL loss. Using an in vivo mouse model of tamoxifen-inducible Bclx gene deletion and in vitro assays with a BCL-XL-selective inhibitor, we interrogated each stage of erythrocyte differentiation for BCL-XL dependency. This revealed that reticulocytes, but not orthochromatic erythroblasts, require BCL-XL for their survival. Surprisingly, concurrent loss of BIM or PUMA had no significant impact on the development of anemia following acute BCL-XL deletion in vivo. However, analysis of mixed bone marrow chimaeric mice revealed that loss of PUMA, but not loss of BIM, partially alleviated impaired erythropoiesis caused by BCL-XL deficiency. Insight into how the network of pro-survival and pro-apoptotic proteins works will assist the development of strategies to mitigate the effects of abnormal cell death during erythropoiesis and prevent anaemia in patients treated with BCL-XL-specific BH3-mimetic drugs.",2017
